hello everyone, welcome to todays’ toast master meeting. Today’s the last days of 2014, tomorrow will be 2015. I wish you all a Happy New Year. This is also our today’s theme. I wish you feel happy in the coming days. 

Happiness means joy and fun. For our club JET - join, enjoy and talk, we can think J also means joy. We’d like you feel fun and interesting when you join JET club. We’d like you have no pressure and enjoy yourself when you stand here, when you share your stories. 

When we share our happy stories, others will also get happy. Our happiness will get doubled, tripled or multipled. While when share our sad stories others can also feel it. They maybe give comments, suggestion or help. Then we will get relieved. Our sadness will be divided or minimized. 

This stage will enlarge our happiness and minimize our sadness. What a magic place. So please do not hesitate, please forget your fear or pressure. Please come to this stage and share your stories, your happiness or sadness.
