From Success to Failure
In the ancient China the oranges in Huainan were sweet and delicious. Then someone planted some seeds in Huaibei. But the oranges which grew out were bitter and acid. The orange trees succeeded to produce the sweet fruit in Huainan but failed in Huanbei. This Chinese idiom story tells us the output will be different when the environment changes. 
Now from the Darwin’s evolution theory we know the orange tree in Huainan adapted to Huainan’s natural environment. The root, truck, leaves, flowers and fruits adapted to the sunlight, wind, water and field of Huainan. And all of these will be recorded in the seed, in the gene, in the DNA.  The environment may change but the genes cannot. The genes help the orange sweet in Huainan but bitter in Huaibei.
This rule works for plants and also works for peoples. The genes of the past success may lead to the later failure when the environment changes. 
I learned this with several failures. I succeeded when I studied in the high school. The genes of my success were "focus" and "ask why". Focus means I only noticed and cared the books, the knowledge. "Ask why" means I did not only want the answer but the best way to get it. I always did these year by year. Then they became my habits, my characters and my genes.  They made me success in the high school, but did not in the university. 
My study in university is still good but the study was not the only important things in the university. At that time boys started to date and fall in love with girls.
One day I met a girl in the university, she was so beautiful and I liked her at once. Later I found she always went to one classroom to do the homework. So I decided to follow her, sit behind her and study too. Several days later when I studied I found an interesting mathematics problem and worked hard to solve it. Suddenly the girl put away her bag and stood up. She spoke to me in a soft voice "I've finished and am going to leave". But I was still focusing on the problem so I said "I still have a problem, you can go ahead". This time my gene "focus" failed me.
I learned from this failure. I tried to switch my focus. Later I met another girl. We started to date. We went shopping or saw a movie. But my second habit troubled me. I always wanted to clarify the meanings. For an example I will asked "Why we see this film not that one?", "Why do you buy this cloth, which is similar to your another one?" Then we would begin to argue. At last the girl shouted to me: "I don't like the boy always asking 'why?'" and we broke up. The girl wanted a boy “No why just buy”. I failed again because of the gene “ask more why” of the former success.
I was not stupid: I knew my genes of the past success led to my failures. But I cannot changes so easily because I had spent more than ten years on them. I made more success the habits become more strong. Then it will be more difficult for me to change, to adapt to the new challenges. It will be more possible for me to fail. 
From this view the success is the father of the failure. The success is like a boy, the failure is like a girl. They grow up and get married. The genes of success and failure mixed up and give birth to some child: the new success or failure.  These stories happened on every time and everywhere. Today I had shared mine. what’s yours? Have you failed from the former success?
