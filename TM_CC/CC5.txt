From Success to Failure
In the ancient China the oranges in Huainan were sweet and delicious. Then someone planted some seeds in Huaibei. But the growed out oranges were bitter acid. The orange tree succeeded to produce the sweet fruit in Huainan but failed in Huanbei. This Chinese idiom story tells us the output will be different when the environment changes. 
Now from the Darwin’s evolution theory we know the orange tree in Huainan adapted to Huainan’s natural environment. The root, truck, leaves, flowers and fruits adapted to the sunlight, wind, water and field of Huainan but not Huaibei. And all of these will be recorded in the seed, in the gene, in the DNA.  The environment for the plant may change but the genes of the plant cannot. The genes help the orange sweet and delicious in Huainan but bitter and acid in Huaibei.
This rule works for plants and also works for people. The gene of the past success may lead to the later failure. 
I succeeded when I studied in the high school. The genes were "focus" and "ask why". Focus means I only noticed and cared the books, the knowledge. "Ask why" means I did not only want the answer but the best way to get it. I always do this year by year even they became my habits, my characters and my genes.  They made me success in the high school, but did not in the university. 
My study in university is still good but the study was not the only important things. Still for you? Are you kidding? In the university boys started to date and fell in love with girls.
One day I met a girl in the university, she was so beautiful and I liked her at once. Later I found she always went to one classroom to do the homework. So I decided to follow her, sit behind her and study too. Several days later when I studied I found an interesting mathematics problem and so worked hard to solve it. Suddenly the girl put away her bag and stood up. She spoke to me in a soft voice "I've finished and am going to leave". But I still focused on mathematics so I said "I still have a problem, you can go ahead". This time my "focus" failed me.
Later I learned from this failure. I put less focus on the study and I was lucky I met another girl. We started to date. We went shopping or saw a movie. But my second habit troubled me. I always wanted to clarify some issues. For an example I will asked "Why we see this film not that one?", "Why do you buy this cloth, which is similar to your another one?" Then we would begin to quarrel. One day later the girl shouted to me: "I don't like the boy always asking 'why?'" and we broke up. I failed again because of the gene of the former success.
I was not stupid: I knew my genes of the past success led to my failures. But I cannot changes so easily after all I had spent more than ten years on them. I made more success the habits become more strong. Then it will be more difficult for me to change, to adapt to the new challenges. It will be more possible for me to fail. 
From this view the success is the father of the failure. The success is like a boy, the failure is like a girl. They grow up and get married. The genes of success and failure mixed up and give birth to some children: the new success or failure.  These stories happened on everyone and everywhere. Today I had shared mine what’s yours?
