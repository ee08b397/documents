From Success to Failure
In the ancient China the oranges in Huainan were sweet and delicious. Then someone planted some seeds in Huaibei. But the oranges became bitter and acid. The orange trees succeeded in Huainan but failed in Huanbei. This Chinese idiom story tells us the output may be different when the environment changes. 
Now from the Darwin’s evolution theory we knew the orange tree in Huainan adapted to the local natural environment. The root, truck, leaves, flowers and fruits adapted to the sunlight, wind, water and field of Huainan. And all of these will be recorded in the seed, in the DNA, in the genes. The environment change easily from Huainai to Huaibei but the genes cannot. The genes made the orange sweet in Huainan but bitter in Huaibei.
This rule works for plants and also works for peoples. The genes of the past success may lead to the later failure because the environment changes. 
I learned this by my several failures. When I was in the high school I succeeded in study. The genes of my success were "focus" and "ask why". Focus means I only noticed and cared the exams, books, the knowledge. "Ask why" means I did not only want the correct answer but the best way to get it. I did these years by years and they help me succeed. Then they became my habits, my characters and my genes. They made me success in the high school, but did not in the university. 
My study in the university was still good but the study was not the only important things in the university. In the university boy started to date girls.
One day I met a girl in the university, she was so beautiful and I liked her at once. Later I found she always went to one classroom to do the homework. So I followed her, sat behind her and studied too. Several days later when I studied I found an interesting mathematics problem and worked hard to solve it. Suddenly the girl put away her bag and stood up. She spoke to me in a soft voice when she passed me "I've finished and am going to leave". But I was still focusing on the problem so I said "I still have a problem, you can go ahead". My gene "focus" let the girl go and failed me.
I learned from this failure and started to switch my focus from study to romance. Later I met another girl. We started to date. We went shopping or saw movies. But my second gene troubled me. I always wanted to clarify the meanings of choices. I couldn’t help asking “why?” before the decisions. For an example I will asked "Why we see this movie not that one?", "Why do you buy this cloth, which is similar to your another one?" Then we would begin to argue before the choices. At last the girl shouted to me: "I don't like the boy who always asking 'why?'" The girl wanted a boy “No why just buy” but I couldn’t stop asking why. So we broke up. The gene “ask why” failed me again.
I knew my genes of the past success led to my failures. But I cannot changes so easily because I had spent more than ten years on them. I made more success the genes become more strong. Then it will be more difficult for me to change, to adapt to the new environments, new challenges. It will be more possible for me to fail. 
We always say “Failure is the mother of success”. The failure is like a woman and so the success is like a man. They love each other and get married. The genes of success and failure mixed up and give birth to the child: the new success or failure. From this view the success is the father of the failure because failure has the genes of success. 
Today I had shared my stories: how my former success led to my later failure. These stories happened every time and everywhere. Have you failed from your former success?
