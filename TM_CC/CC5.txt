From Success To Failure
In the ancient China the oranges in Huainan were sweet and delicious. Then some guy planted some seeds in Huaibei. But the growed out oranges were bitter acid. The orange tree succeeded to produce the sweet fruit in Huainan but failed in Huanbei. This Chinese idiom story tells us the success may come to failure. Now from the Darwin’s evolution theory we know the orange tree in Huainan is adapted to Huainan’s natural environment. The root, truck, leaves, flowers and fruits are adapted to Huainai but not Huaibei. And all of these will be recorded in DNA, gene.  The environment will change but the gene of the plant cannot. 
This rule works for plants and also works for people. The gene of my past success led to the failure. 
I succeeded when I studied in high school. The genes of this success were "focus" and "ask more why". Focus means I only noticed and cared the books, the knowledge. "Ask more why" means I did not only want the correct answer but the best way to get it. I always do this year by year even they became my two habits, they became my characters.  They made me success in high school, but did not in the university. My study in university is still good but the study was not only important things. Still for you. Are you kidding? In the university boys started to hang over and date with girls.
One day I met a girl in the university, she was so beautiful and I liked her at once. Later I found she always went to one classroom to do the homework. So I decided to follow her, sit behind and study. Several days later I just studied at the seat behind her. I found a interesting mathematics problem and so worked hard to solve it. Suddenly the girl put away the bag and stood up. She spoke to me "I've finished". But I still focused on mathematics so I said "I still have a problem, you can go ahead". This time my "focus" failed me.
Later I learned from this failure. I put less focus on the study and I was lucky I met another girl. We started to go shopping or cinema. But my second habit troubled me. I always wanted to clarify the understanding and activities. So I will asked "Why we see this film not that one?", "Why do you buy this cloth, which is similar to your another one?" Then we would begin to quarrel. Later we broken up and the girl said "No, I don't like the boy always asking 'why?'".
I was not stupid: I knew my genes of the past success led to my failures. But I cannot changes so easily after all I had spent more than ten years on them. This means the more success I made the habits to success would become strong. Then it will be more difficult to change to adapt to the new challenges. It will be more possible to fail. 
From this view the success is the father of the failure. The success is like a boy, the failure is like a girl. They grow up and get married. The genes of success and failure mixed up and will give birth to some children: the new success or failure.  These stories happened on everyone and everywhere. Today I had shared mine what’s yours?
