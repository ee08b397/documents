Relax
Have you heard a story about the race between a rabbit and turtle when you are children? The rabbit failed because he slept during the race. My parents always reminded me this story: not acting like the rabbit. You must always study hard and rest less otherwise you will lose. This gave me a lot of pressure.
One day in school I had a Botany class. I did not like it at all and thought it was boring so I had a nap – a short sleep. Later I waked up I found I got refreshed and reenergized. But I did not like to see the teacher and kept the gesture of sleep. I could hear, remember and understand what the teacher said – so clearly. I felt very happy. Unfortunately the teacher wasn’t happy because he noticed me. “Deng Haijun! Stand up!”. Then He asked several questions. I answered them very easy. The teacher cannot say any words but asked me to sit down. 
From this I realized a good sleep may help us do better because it will relax us.  The relaxation will help us do better. This will make us easier to success. Many times we are told “failure is the mother of success”. Maybe sleep, a nice sleep is the father of the success. After all they share the same first letter – S.
A nice sleep is a good way to relax but not the only way. Many times we just need forget the pressure.  Then we can feel  and do better.
One day I got sick and had a fever before an exam. I couldn’t read the books and prepare the exam any more. And my parents also told me: ”Forget the exam, and just relax. After all the health is most important”. So I was very happy. I ate some apples, sat on bed and watched TV and totally forgot the exam and pressure. At last I was recovered before the exam. Shall I fail because I did not prepare for this exam at the last moment? No, I got the highest score in my class. I thought the only reason is that I was the most relaxed one and had no any pressure.
But how can we relax ourselves? How can we forget the pressure?  Got sick every time. No. Just repeat “relax! relax” to ourselves. It will not relax but give us more pressure. Someone found sports will help them relax. But I found reading can relax me. Oh of course I am not talking about the textbooks but the stories, especially the sword-man stories.
Before the college entrance exam we were given 1 day to relax. Many of my classmates still studied hard and prepared for the exam till the last minute. But I didn’t. I just needed relax myself. So I borrowed a sword-man story book <Tian Long Ba Bu> written by Jin Yong. I was totally abstracted by this book and forgot the pressure. I took the exam in a very relaxed mood.  And the first thing after I finished the exam was trying to find more stories.  The result of the exam was very good. Thank you, Mr. Jin Yong.
Forget the pressure and get relax will help us success. But maybe we should forget the success, because the pursuit of success gives us the pressure and block us to do the best and block us from success itself. And also it is very different to distinguish the success and failure. 
 Back to the story of race between rabbit and turtle. Do you really think the rabbit is the loser? One day I met this rabbit and asked him: “Why did you sleep?”. His answer surprised me:” I met a female rabbit and fall in love with her, but the writer wouldn’t let the students know this”. “Then do you regret?” “No. I lost a race but won a love” So you see it is clear “you can’t win all and the failure is not terrible”. 
So please forget the success and fear to failure. Get relax and do your best. Be yourself!
