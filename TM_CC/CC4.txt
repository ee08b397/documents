Relax and do your best
Have you heard the story about the race of turtle and rabbit? Yes? Then I won’t repeat it to save time. The rabbit failed because he slept during the race. My parents always reminded me this story when I was a child: not acting like the rabbit. You must always study hard and rest less otherwise others will overtake you and you will lose. This gave me a lot of pressure. But I strongly doubt that the rabbit may run faster and overtake the turtle after he relaxed.
One day in school I had a Botany class. I did not like it at all and thought it was boring so I had a nap – a short sleep. Later I waked up I found I got refreshed and reenergized. But I did not like to see the teacher and kept the gesture of sleep. I could hear, remember and understand what the teacher said – so clearly. I felt very happy to have this relaxation. But unfortunately the teacher wasn’t happy because he noticed me. “Deng Haijun! Stand up!”. Then He asked me several questions. But I answered them very easily and correctly. The teacher cannot say any words but asked me to sit down. 
From this I realized a good sleep will relax us and help us do better.  This will make us easier to success. Many times we are told “failure is the mother of success”. Maybe sleep, a nice sleep is the father of the success. After all they share the same first letter – S.
A nice sleep is a good way to relax and success but not the only way. Many times we just need forget the pressure and then we can do better.
One day I got sick and had a fever before an exam. I couldn’t read the books and prepare the exam any more. My parents told me: ”Forget the exam, and just relax.”. So I was very happy. I ate some apples, sat on bed and watched TV. I totally forgot the exam and pressure. At last I was recovered before the exam. Shall I fail because I did not prepare for this exam? No, I got the highest score in my class. I thought the only reason was that I was the most relaxed and had no pressure.
But how can we forget the pressure? How can we relax ourselves?  Get sick every time. No. Just repeat “relax! Relax!” to ourselves. It will not relax but give us more pressure. At last I found reading can relax me. Oh of course I am not talking about the textbooks but the stories, especially the sword-man stories.
Before the college entrance exam we were given 1 day’s holiday. Many of my classmates still studied hard and prepared for the exam. But I didn’t. I knew I needed relax. So I borrowed a sword-man story book <Tian Long Ba Bu> written by Jin Yong and started to read. I was totally abstracted by this book and forgot the pressure. I took the exam in a very relaxed mood. I succeed: the result was good. Thank you, Mr. Jin Yong.
Forgetting the pressure can relax us and help us success. But maybe we should forget the success itself, because the pursuit of success is the root of the pressure and block us to do the best and then block us from success itself. 
 Let’s back to the story of turtle and rabbit. One day I met this rabbit and interviewed him: “Why did you sleep?”. His answer surprised me:” I met a female rabbit and fell in love with her. So I decided to stay and forgot the race. But the writer wouldn’t let the students know this”. “Then do you regret?” “No. I lost a race but won a love, a family”. 
So please forget the success, the pressure and the fear to failure. Get relax and do your best.
