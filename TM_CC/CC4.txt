Bad Memory

In my last prepared speech I forget swimming glass and got some danger. And my bad memory confuse me in the everydays's life. Someday I take some pill but I forget to taste the water. I put the pills in my mouth and drink. Ah. it is hot. And very the worse things happened. Someday I went to swim. I finish and got out. My brain needed more oxcegen after think. Suddenly I met a friend we had not met for a long. He said "Hi Haijun, how are you". "Yeah, fine. Thank you. And you". My brain runs quickly. Ah he have the same family with my wife, Wang. "You are lao wang ba". So then another swimming accident.

So I must solve this. For working issues and knowledge we found some tools to help us. OneNote, Evernote. And jira for the bug, oh we need a password to login these tools. I set them to one two three four six, oh sorry I forget five. But for band cards this is not safe enougth. What is the password? Call me. not correct. Then should be my wife's number.

I always prepare a check list but sometimes I can not find it. So I record them in iPhone.But then I cann't find my phone. So I borrow Lao Zhang and call my number. But it did not show my name but idiot. Thanks you like my CC1.
