I am pleased to be the Timer of today’s meeting. It’s the 3rd time for me to be the timer, but the former 2 times were not successful. This role is not so easy as I thought. I decided to challenge myself again.

My duty is to remind all other to follow the timing rules. I'd like explain the timing rule very shortly. 

For prepared speeches and the general evaluation when you have 2 minutes left I will raise the Green Card, the Yellow Card, if you have only 1 minute left. the Red Card, it means your time is up. I will ring the bell if you overtime 30 seconds. And you must stop and leave at once.

For all other roles, I will raise the Green Card, when you have 1 minute left, the Yellow Card, when you have 30 seconds left. When Red Card, it means your time is up. I will ring the bell if you overtime 15 seconds. And you must stop and leave at once.

For table topic speaker you have 30 seconds to think before your speech.

Please us follow these rules and make a successful meeting.

Based on today’s schedule we can have 6 table topic speakers.

I will give a report at the end of the meeting.
