I’m Deng Haijun from JET. I am pleased to be the Timer of today’s meeting. My duty is to remind all other to follow the timing rules. For prepared speeches I will raise the Green Flag, it means you have 2 minutes left, the Yellow Flag, if you have only 1 minute left. the Red Flag, it means your time is up. I will ring the bell if you overtime 30 seconds. And you must stop and leave at once.
 For all other roles, I will raise the Green Flag, when you have 1 minute left, the Yellow Flag, when you have only 30 seconds left. When you see the Red Flag, it means your time is up. I will ring the bell if you overtime 15 seconds. And you must stop and leave at once.
 Any comments, No, OK, I will give a report at the end of the meeting.
