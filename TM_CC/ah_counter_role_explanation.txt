I am today's Ah Counter. My role is to note and keep track of the inappropriate words and sounds used as a crutch or pause filler by anyone who speaks during the meeting. The words includes the unnecessary interjections, such as ‘and’, ‘well’, ‘but’, ‘so’, ‘like’, ‘you know’ as well as the sounds include ‘ah’,‘um’, ‘er’. I will note any uses of the crutch or filler words mentioned. 

I am today's Ah Counter. 
My role is to counter the unnecessary words and voice used for conjunction or pause filler.
The words include but not limit to ‘and’, ‘well’, ‘but’, ‘so’, ‘like’.
The voice include but not limit to ah’,‘um’, ‘er’.
I will note all of these and make a report at the end.
All of these unnecessary words and voice in the speech will make the speech boring and let the audience lost. 
They are speech pests, they are speech killers.
Let's work together to get rid of them.
