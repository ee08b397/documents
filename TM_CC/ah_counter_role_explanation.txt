My role as Ah Counter is to note and keep track of words and sounds used as a crutch or pause filler by anyone who speaks during the meeting. The use of inappropriate interjections such as ‘and’, ‘well’, ‘but’, ‘so’, ‘like’, ‘you know’ as well as sounds like ‘ah’,‘um’, ‘er’ will be met with an audible click . I will note any uses of the crutch or filler words mentioned.
