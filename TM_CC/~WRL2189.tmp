Power of music
In 2008 seven years ago it was September,  I worked in NSN and visited Berlin for business. I wondered in the city at the weekend. It was cloudy, windy and a bit cold. And many Berliners only spoke Germany. I was a bit disappointed and in low mood. At the 10 clock I arrived at the square of republic, which is like the TianAnMen square in Beijing, just covered by grass. At there I saw a group of younger, about twenty guys.  They are playing drum, dong-dong-dong. The music was not famous, but was so beautiful and powerful. It just like the sunlight which just come from the cloud, made me warm and excited.  It was the first time I know the power of the music, the power to inspire the people.
Later I know more about the power of the music. The different music has different power. Some music has the power to tell story, like the Main Title by Ramin Djawadi  in the TV show the Game of Throne, which Chi Fengxin played in his last speech. The music has the power to relax us, like Summer of Joe Hisaishi in movie Kikujiro, we can feel the happiness of the little boy when he left the school and ran home.  Some music can make us sad, we will feel the heart broken when we listen to Liang Zhu.
Music has variables of powers, and more these power can overcome many obstacles easily.  The power of music can overcome the difference of language. I didn¡¯t understand Germany but I can get inspired by the music they played. The power of the music can overcome the age. I felt difficult to explain my jobs to my grandparents but they thought it pleasant and interesting when I played the songs of the legend of phoenix. The power of the music can overcome the obstacle of civilization. Many African tribes don¡¯t had their own writing, but they have their music.
Yes, the music had many other powers, which I didn¡¯t know. But where did the power come from or why the music has power? I think it is because the music is beautiful; it is the beautiful of the sound. Everyone like the beauty, love the beauty and chase for the beauty. The beauty of music got echo from us. Our breathing, our pulse and our heartbeat followed the music, embraced the music and saluted to the music. The beauty of music inspires the power of ourselves and leads us to itself; let us feel its power.
I think my words cannot convince you because I haven¡¯t its power. So I decide to let the music do this. This is the movie Shawshank Redemption. The major character Andy Dufresne was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to?the prison. One day he found a record and broadcasted to all of the prisoners, who may not know the name or composer, but they still can feel the beauty of music, the power of music. OK let see this part of video. This music is The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart, chapter 2.
