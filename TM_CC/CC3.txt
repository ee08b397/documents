Lessons 
from Swimming accident

Ten years ago, I started to swim. Someday I went to a swimming pool. It is not in rectangle, but in some kidney shape. And it have some 
 no swimming lines. Most badly I forget my swimming glass home.
So I try to swim without it, I jump into the pool and start. I found my eyes would got hurt so I closed my eyes and just swam near the border.  
En everything is OK. But suddenly my musules got pain, so I swam hard to try to got on the bank. 
I tried to open the eyes but still hurt and cannot see the border. I tried to stand up but I can not reach the bottom. I had swam to deep zone.
What can I do? I shout out for "help": Jiu ming - but some water came into my mouth.
First lesson I learned is do not be 
secondly the direction is import
lastly english some times matters
