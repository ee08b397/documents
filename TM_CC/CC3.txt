Bad Memory
My bad memory confused me in the everyday life. Someday I got a cold and was going to take some pills but I forget to taste the water. I put the pills in my mouth and drink. Ah. it was very hot. So I was not cold any more. 
And my bad memory caused worse things. Someday I walked out and suddenly I met a friend we had not met for a long. He said "Hi Haijun, how are you". "Yeah, fine. Thank you. And you". My brain runs quickly. Ah he has the same family with my wife, Wang. "You are lao wang ba". So PIA PIA.When I went home my wife asked "what's happened to you". "Just fall when run" "Stop running and go swim"
So I swim. When I arrived at the swimming pool I found I forget my swimming glass at home. However I try to swim without it, I jump into the pool and start. I found my eyes would got hurt so I closed my eyes and just swam near the border.  En everything is OK. But suddenly my muscles got pain, so I swam hard to try to get on the bank. I tried to open the eyes but still hurt and cannot see the border. I tried to stand up but I cannot reach the bottom. I had swum into the deep zone.
So I must solve this. For working issues and knowledge we found some tools to help us. OneNote, Evernote. And jira for the bug, oh we need a password to login these tools. I set them to one two three four six, oh sorry I forget five. But for band cards this is not safe enougth. What is the password? Call me. not correct. Then should be my wife's number.
I always prepare a check list but sometimes I cannot find it. So I record them in iPhone. But then I cann't find my phone. So I borrow Lao Zhang and call my number. But it did not show my name but idiot. Thanks you like my CC1.
