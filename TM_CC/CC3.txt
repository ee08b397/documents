Bad Memory

Today I’d like share one of my shortcomings, the bad memory. For me sometimes it is so easy to forget but so hard to remember. My bad memory confused and troubled me a lot.

Someday I got a cold and needed to take some pills. But I forget to taste the temperature of the water. I threw the pills in my mouth and started to drink. Ah! It was very hot. Even I was not cold any more. This time my bad memory hurt my lips a little.

But later my bad memory caused worse things. Someday I walked out and suddenly I met a friend we had not met for a long. He said "Hi Haijun, how are you". "Yeah, fine. Thank you. And you". “Yeah, still OK, do you still remember me?” But I totally forget his name. It was so embarrassing to forget friends’ name. Ah, wait, he has the same family name with my wife, Wang. "You are lao wang ba". So PIA PIA. This time my bad memory hurt my face badly. 

When I went home my wife asked "what happened to you". "Just fall when run" "Stop running and go swim”. So I went to swim. But I forget my swimming glasses at home. I decided to swim without it. However I found my eyes would get hurt so I closed my eyes.  En at the beginning everything is OK. But suddenly my leg got pain. I tried to stand up but failed. I had come to deep zone because I lost the direction. And I cannot see the border. So the only thing I can do is shouting out "HELP". I got saved at last. This time my bad memory almost killed me.

So I must solve this problem. I must make sure my bad memory will not hurt me so badly again. I think over and over and found three solutions:

Firstly I need to organize the belongings clearly and carefully. So I bought a bag with many pockets, I put the things in different pockets. The key is in pocket one, the badge is in pocket two, the phone is in pocket three. Then I can just check the bag’s pockets to make sure I have taken them all. I do all of these to my life, which eventually make me got an illness: I even must organize the money to make sure they arranged neatly. I will feel very uneasy if they are in a mess. 
Secondly I connect the things I cannot remember with something famous or easy to remember. For people’s name, I usually connect them to some famous guys. For our club members, Hao Youchao, I will recall as “Hao Ren” a good guy. For Hu Tao, I will remember it as “Hu Jintao”, the ex-president. And for Pan Pu, Oh, let me think, <look out of the window>, SOHO, I connected it to “Pan Shiyi”. the CEO of SOHO. Then our club JET is leaded by "Good Guy",  guided by "the president" and "Pan CEO" is the treasurer. What a wonderful club.

Thirdly I found another person with better memory to help me – my wife. Now when I cannot find something I just ask: “Dear, where is my bag, where is my camera, where is my money?”. Yes, I need ask my wife for the passcode of the bank cards to get the money. And this also have some other impact: someday Mingxin asked me to borrow some money. Then I picked up the phone and said: “I need ask my wife”. He said immediately “Oh, Forget it”. For god’s sake, I just need ask my wife the passcode.

That’s all, how my bad memory hurt me and how I tried to solve it.
