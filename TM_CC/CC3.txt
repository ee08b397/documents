Bad Memory

Today I’d like share one of my weakness, the bad memory. My bad memory confused and troubled me a lot.

One day I got a cold and needed to take some pills. But I forgot to check the temperature of the water. I threw the pills in my mouth and started to drink. Ah! It was very hot. This time my bad memory hurt my lips a little.

Later my bad memory caused worse things. One day I met an old friend when I walked out. We had not met for several years. He asked me "Hi Haijun, do you still remember me?” I remembered his family name is Wang, but forgot his last name. So I answers “ Yes. You are lao wang ba". So PIA PIA. This time my bad memory hurt my face badly. 

When I went home my wife asked "what happened to you". "Just fall when run" "Stop running and go swim”. So I went to swim. But I forgot my swimming glasses at home. I decided to swim without it. However I found my eyes would get pain so I closed my eyes and continued.  En at the beginning everything was OK. But suddenly my leg got pain. I tried to stand up but failed. I had come to the deep zone because I lost the direction. So the only thing I can do was shouting out "HELP". I got saved at last. This time my bad memory almost killed me.

So I must solve this problem. I must make sure my bad memory will not hurt me so badly again. I think over and over and found three solutions:

Firstly I organize the belongings clearly. I bought a bag with many pockets, I put the things into different pockets. The key is in pocket one, the badge is in pocket two, the phone is in pocket three. Then I just need check the bag’s pockets to make sure I have taken all needed. I followed this example for many cases in the daily life. This works fine and I am still alive. However this is not applicable for the case of people’s name.

So my second solution is to connect the things with something easy to remember. For people’s name, I usually connect them to some famous guys. For example our club members, When I met Hao Youchao first time, I will recall as “Hao Ren” a good guy. For Hu Tao, I will remember it as “Hu Jintao”, the ex-president. And for Pan Pu I connected it to “Pan Shiyi”. the CEO of SOHO. Then our club JET is led by "a good guy",  guided by "the president Hu Jintao" and "Pan Shiyi CEO" is the treasurer. What a wonderful club. This solution works also fine and help me to keep my face. But there are still some cases which cannot be solved by these two solutions.

My third, last and ultimate solution is my wife. She had a pretty good memory. Now when I cannot find something I just ask her: “Dear, where is my bag, where is my camera, where is my money?”. Yes, I need ask my wife for the passcode of the bank cards. And this also has some other impact: someday Mingxin asked me for some money. Then I picked up the phone and said: “I need ask my wife”. He said immediately “Oh, Forget it”. For god’s sake, I just need ask my wife the passcode. Minxin misunderstood me. Until now this works fine because I only need remember my wife.

That’s all, how my bad memory hurt me and how I fight back. But the war between me and my bad memory is not over. I must find more solutions for new cases. Otherwise my bad memory may kill me with a cup of hot water in the future.
