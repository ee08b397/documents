Bad Memory
When I face and take the challenge I think I’m brave. But I think maybe I’m much braver to face the shortcoming of myself. One of my shortcomings is the bad memory. My bad memory confused and troubled me a lot. 
Someday I got a cold and need to take pills. But I forget to taste the temperature of the water. I put the pills in my mouth and started to drink the water. Ah! It was very hot. Even I was not old any more. This time my bad memory just hurt my lips a little.
But later my bad memory caused worse things. Someday I walked out and suddenly met a friend, we hadn’t met for several years. He said "Hi Haijun, how are you". "Yeah, fine. Thank you. And you". “Yeah, still OK, do you still remember me?” But I totally forget his name. It was so embarrassing to forget the name of a friend. Ah, wait, he has the same family name with my wife, Wang. "You are lao wang ba". So PIA PIA. When I went home my wife asked "what happened to you". "Just fall when run" "Stop running and go swim"
So I went to swim. But unfortunately forget my swimming glasses at home. I decided to swim without them. I jump into the pool and start. I found my eyes got hurt so I closed my eyes and just swam near the border.  En at the beginning everything is OK. But suddenly my muscles got pain. I tried to stand up but I cannot reach the bottom. I had swum into the deep zone because I closed my eyes. I swam harder and harder but I still cannot get the border as my direction is totally wrong. Oh, at last the only thing I can do is shouting out "HELP". I got saved at last. This time my bad memory almost killed me.
So I must solve this. I must make sure my bad memory will not hurt me badly again. I think over and over and found three methods/solutions:
Firstly I need to organize the belongings clearly and carefully. So I bought a bag with many pockets, I put the things in different pocket. The key is in pocket one, the badge is in pocket two, the phone is in pocket three. Then I can just check the bag’s pockets to make sure I have taken all belongings. I do all of these to my life, which make me got an illness: I even must organize the money to make sure they arranged neatly. I will feel very uneasy if they are in a mess. It is not acceptable when I see the man kiss a man, even he is Chairmen Mao. 
Secondly I connect the things I cannot remember with something famous or easy to remember. For the people’s name, I usually connect them to famous guys. For our club members, Hao Youchao, I will recall as “Hao Ren” a good guy. For Hu Tao, I will remember it as “Hu Jintao”, the ex-president. And for Pan Pu, Oh, let me think, <look out of the window>, SOHO, I connected it to “Pan Shiyi”. the CEO of SOHO. Then our club JET is leaded by "Good Guy",  guided by "the president" and "Pan CEO" is the treasurer. What a wonderful club.
Thirdly I got another person with better memory to help me – my wife. Now when I cannot find something I just ask: “Dear, where is my bag, where is my phone, where is my camera, where is my money?”. Yes, I need ask my wife for the passcode of the bank cards to get the money.  And this also have some other impact: someday Mingxin asked me to borrow some money. Then I picked up the phone and said: “I need ask my wife”. He said immediately “Forget it”. Oh, I just need ask my wife the passcode.
That’s all, about my bad memory and how I work hard to solve it.
