字幕修改：海上升明日（2007年11月23日）

2
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,780
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

3
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,140
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

4
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,220
It was very bitter.

5
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,660
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

6
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,500
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

7
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,260
-What was your response?
-I told her I would not grant one.

8
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,500
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

9
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,900
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

10
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,460
If they say so.

11
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,380
I really don't remember.
I was upset.

12
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,980
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

13
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,780
She packed a bag.

14
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,940
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

15
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,500
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

16
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,700
...whom you had discovered
was your wife 's lover.

17
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,060
Did you follow her?

18
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,380
I went to a few bars first.

19
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,740
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

20
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,780
I parked in the turnout...

21
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,380
...and waited.

22
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,180
With what intention?

23
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,140
I'm not sure.

24
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,620
I was confused...

25
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
...drunk.

26
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,540
I think...

27
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,740
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

28
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,220
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

29
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,460
I was sobering up.

30
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,140
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

31
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,180
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

32
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,300
I've been very clear on this point.

33
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,420
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

34
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,100
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

35
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
...riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

36
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,660
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

37
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,500
Yes, it does.

38
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

39
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
...before the murders took place.

40
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,260
That's very convenient.

41
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,020
It's the truth.

42
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,780
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

43
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,860
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

44
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,420
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

45
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,300
And that also...

46
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,060
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

47
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
Since I am innocent of this crime...

48
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,980
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

49
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,340
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

50
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,220
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

51
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,180
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

52
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,220
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

53
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,900
And most of all...

54
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,060
...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

55
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,180
...lying dead in each other's arms.

56
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,820
They had sinned.

57
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,420
But was their crime so great...

58
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,780
...as to merit a death sentence?

59
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,180
While you think about that...

60
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,300
...think about this:

61
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,700
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

62
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,420
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

63
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,300
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

64
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,500
No.

65
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,820
This was revenge...

66
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,260
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

67
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,740
Four bullets per victim.

68
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,100
Not six shots fired, but eight.

69
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,060
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

70
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,100
...and then stopped to reload...

71
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,700
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

72
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,340
An extra bullet per lover...

73
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,740
...right in the head.

74
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,740
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

75
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,140
It chills my blood just to look at you.

76
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,660
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

77
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,980
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

78
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,740
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

79
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,980
Sit.

80
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,020
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

81
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:11,020
-Yes, sir.
-You feel you've been rehabilitated?

82
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,900
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

83
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,900
I mean, I learned my lesson.

84
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,220
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

85
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,580
I'm no longer a danger to society.

86
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,660
That's God's honest truth.

87
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,740
Hey, Red.

88
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,180
How'd it go?

89
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,460
Same old shit, different day.

90
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,460
Yeah, I know how you feel.

91
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,580
I'm up for rejection next week.

92
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,780
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

93
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,220
It happens.

94
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,780
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

95
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,140
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

96
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,300
Four!

97
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,660
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

98
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

99
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,780
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

100
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,260
...bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

101
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,500
Damn near anything within reason.

102
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,260
Yes, sir!
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

103
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,900
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

104
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,540
...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

105
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,900
...I told him, "No problem. "

106
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,140
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

107
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,060
...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

108
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,260
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

109
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,420
Good work for a man so young.

110
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,580
You speak English, butt-steak?

111
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,580
You follow this officer.

112
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,900
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

113
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,580
Hey, fish! Come over here!

114
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,260
Taking bets today, Red?

115
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,260
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

116
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,060
Smokes. Put me down for two.

117
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,100
All right, who's your horse?

118
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,980
That little sack of shit.

119
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,660
-Eighth. He'll be first.
-Bullshit! I'll take that action.

120
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,940
You're out some smokes, son.

121
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,820
If you're so smart, you call it.

122
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,020
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

123
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,700
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

124
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,380
Fresh fish today!

125
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,540
We're reeling them in!

126
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,700
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

127
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,020
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

128
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
That was my first impression of the man.

129
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,940
What do you say?

130
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,300
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

131
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,540
That guy? Never happen.

132
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,900
-1 0 cigarettes.
-That's a rich bet.

133
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,100
Who's going to prove me wrong?

134
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,020
Heywood? Jigger?

135
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,540
Skeets?

136
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,020
Floyd!

137
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,900
Four brave souls.

138
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,740
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

139
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,100
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

140
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,740
Turn to the right!

141
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,180
Eyes front.

142
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,220
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

143
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

144
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,740
You are convicted felons.

145
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,940
That's why they've sent you to me.

146
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,820
Rule number one:

147
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,420
No blasphemy.

148
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,220
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

149
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,580
The other rules...

150
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,940
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

151
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,300
When do we eat?

152
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,580
You eat when we say you eat.

153
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,900
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

154
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,820
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

155
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,940
On your feet.

156
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,820
I believe in two things:

157
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,380
Discipline and the Bible.

158
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,860
Here, you'll receive both.

159
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,660
Put your trust in the Lord.

160
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,380
Your ass belongs to me.

161
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,980
Welcome to Shawshank.

162
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,220
Unhook them.

163
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,780
Turn around.

164
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,700
That's enough.

165
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,500
Move to the end of the cage.

166
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,860
Turn around. Delouse him.

167
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,140
Turn around.

168
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,460
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

169
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,900
Next man up!

170
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,540
To the right.

171
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Right. Right.

172
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,420
Left.

173
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,500
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

174
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,900
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

175
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,740
...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

176
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,700
And when they put you in that cell...

177
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,140
...and those bars slam home...

178
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,700
...that's when you know it's for real.

179
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,140
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

180
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,540
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

181
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,860
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

182
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,980
Somebody always breaks down crying.

183
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,060
Happens every time.

184
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,660
The only question is...

185
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,540
...who's it going to be?

186
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,700
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

187
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,260
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

188
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,500
Lights out!

189
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,460
I remember my first night.

190
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,060
Seems like a long time ago.

191
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,700
Hey, fish.

192
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,420
Fish, fish.

193
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,620
What are you, scared of the dark?

194
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,460
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

195
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,940
Piggy! Pork!
I want me a pork chop.

196
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,060
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

197
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,180
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

198
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,060
Hey, Fat Ass.

199
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,780
Fat Ass!

200
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,580
Talk to me, boy.

201
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,820
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

202
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,860
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

203
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,900
This place ain't so bad.

204
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,460
Tell you what...

205
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

206
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,100
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

207
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,180
...love to make your acquaintance.

208
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,740
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

209
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,980
God!

210
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,980
I don't belong here!

211
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,860
-We have a winner!
-I want to go home!

212
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,660
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

213
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,060
Fresh fish!

214
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,660
I want to go home!

215
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,740
I want my mother!

216
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,100
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

217
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,180
What the Christ is this horseshit?

218
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,420
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

219
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,900
You'll tell him
with my baton up your ass!

220
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:41,900
Let me out!

221
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,380
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

222
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,420
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

223
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
Not me!

224
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,380
I won't count to three.
Not even to one.

225
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,540
You shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

226
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,620
Shut up, man. Shut up!

227
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,900
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

228
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,300
Open that cell.

229
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,660
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

230
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,780
Son of a bitch!

231
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,740
Captain, take it easy!

232
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,340
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

233
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,820
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

234
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,540
Every last motherfucker in here.

235
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,340
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

236
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,500
His first night in the joint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

237
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,580
He never made a sound.

238
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,580
Tier 3 north, clear count!

239
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,180
Tier 2 north, clear count.

240
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,940
Tier 3 south, clear.

241
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,100
Prepare to roll out.

242
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,980
Roll out!

243
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,780
Are you going to eat that?

244
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,580
I hadn't planned on it.

245
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,780
Do you mind?

246
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,340
That's nice and ripe.

247
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Jake says thank you.

248
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

249
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

250
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,540
Oh, no! Here he comes.

251
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,140
Morning, fellas.

252
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,220
Fine morning, isn't it?

253
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,700
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

254
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,060
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

255
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,780
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

256
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,020
Look at that.

257
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,540
-I can't stand this guy.
-Oh, Lord!

258
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,580
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

259
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,060
Smell my ass!

260
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,180
After he smells mine.

261
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,140
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

262
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,060
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

263
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,700
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

264
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,340
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

265
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,100
Hey, Tyrell.

266
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,380
You pull infirmary duty this week?

267
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,780
How's my horse doing anyway?

268
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,220
Dead.

269
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,140
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

270
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,460
Doc had gone home for the night.

271
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,140
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

272
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,700
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

273
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,980
What was his name?

274
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,460
What'd you say?

275
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,540
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

276
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,860
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

277
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,820
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

278
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,900
Anybody come at you yet?

279
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,700
Anybody get to you yet?

280
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,740
Hey, we all need friends in here.

281
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,660
I could be a friend to you.

282
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,820
Hard to get.

283
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,260
I like that.

284
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,020
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

285
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,220
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

286
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,380
...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

287
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,140
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

288
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,580
...to say more than two words
to somebody.

289
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,220
As it turned out...

290
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,500
...that somebody was me.

291
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,620
I'm Andy Dufresne.

292
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,460
Wife-killing banker.

293
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,860
Why'd you do it?

294
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,260
I didn't, since you ask.

295
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,620
You're going to fit right in.

296
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,380
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

297
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,100
-What you in here for?
-Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

298
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,460
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

299
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,100
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

300
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,700
What do you think?

301
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,020
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

302
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,780
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

303
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,860
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

304
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,500
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

305
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,420
A rock hammer.

306
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:58,340
-What is it and why?
-What do you care?

307
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,260
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

308
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,780
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

309
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,620
Fair enough.

310
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,580
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

311
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,020
-Looks like a miniature pickax.
-Pickax?

312
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,340
For rocks.

313
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,020
Quartz?

314
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,140
And some mica, shale...

315
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,540
...limestone.

316
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,860
So?

317
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,540
So I'm a rock hound.

318
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,900
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

319
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,180
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

320
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,100
No, I have no enemies here.

321
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,460
No? Wait a while.

322
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,580
Word gets around.

323
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,620
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

324
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,660
Especially Bogs.

325
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,940
Don't suppose it would help if l
told them I'm not homosexual.

326
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,500
Neither are they.

327
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,980
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

328
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,540
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

329
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,100
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

330
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,980
-Thanks for the advice.
-Well, that's free.

331
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,180
You understand my concern.

332
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,860
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

333
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,660
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

334
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,100
What did I miss?
What's so funny?

335
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,100
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

336
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,980
What's an item like this usually go for?

337
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,580
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

338
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,420
My normal markup's 20 percent.

339
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,900
But this is a specialty item.

340
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,380
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 1 0 bucks.

341
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,860
Ten it is.

342
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,460
Waste of money, if you ask me.

343
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,980
Why's that?

344
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,220
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

345
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,660
They find it, you're going to lose it.

346
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,860
If they catch you, you don't know me.

347
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,220
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

348
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,660
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

349
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,980
I understand.

350
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Thank you, Mr....

351
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,300
Red.

352
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,260
Name's Red.

353
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,220
Why do they call you that?

354
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,740
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

355
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,300
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

356
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,500
He had a quiet way about him...

357
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,780
...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

358
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,580
He strolled...

359
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,780
...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

360
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,420
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

361
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,460
I think it'd be fair to say...

362
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,820
...I liked Andy from the start.

363
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,980
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

364
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,580
Move it! Come on, move it!

365
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,860
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

366
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,860
Andy was right.

367
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,220
I finally got the joke.

368
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,820
It would take a man about 600 years...

369
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,380
...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

370
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,340
-Book?
-Not today.

371
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,060
Book?

372
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,180
Delivery for Dufresne.

373
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,700
Here's your book.

374
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,660
Thanks.

375
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,260
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

376
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,500
This will blind you.

377
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,180
Honey, hush.

378
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,100
That's it. You fight!

379
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,740
Better that way.

380
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,580
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

381
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,700
...and the Sisters let him be.

382
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,980
I wish I could tell you that...

383
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,020
...but prison is no fairy-tale world.

384
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,020
He never said who did it.

385
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,780
But we all knew.

386
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,820
Things went on like that for a while.

387
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,620
Prison life consists of routine...

388
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,740
...and then more routine.

389
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,540
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

390
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,700
The Sisters kept at him.

391
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,900
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

392
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,540
Sometimes not.

393
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,740
And that's how it went for Andy.

394
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,980
That was his routine.

395
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,060
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

396
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,780
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

397
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,460
...this place would have
got the best of him.

398
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,860
But then, in the spring of 1949...

399
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,900
...the powers that be decided:

400
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,260
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

401
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,540
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

402
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,660
As you know...

403
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,740
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

404
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,220
It was outdoor detail...

405
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,740
...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

406
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,220
Stay in line there.

407
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,460
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

408
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,420
Wallace E. Unger.

409
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,180
Ellis Redding.

410
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,860
Wouldn't you know it?

411
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,500
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

412
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,580
Andrew Dufresne.

413
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,780
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

414
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,660
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

415
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,140
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

416
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,820
I say, "Yeah?"

417
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,580
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

418
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,540
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-I'm not. He was an asshole.

419
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,860
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

420
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,220
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

421
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,420
"He died a rich man." Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

422
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,820
A million bucks?

423
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,420
-Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
-You going to see any of that?

424
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,660
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

425
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,980
Dollars?

426
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,580
That's great! That's like
winning the sweepstakes.

427
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,980
Isn't it?

428
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,020
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

429
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,460
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

430
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,500
Poor Byron.

431
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,420
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

432
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,740
Some people really got it awful.

433
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,340
Andy, are you nuts?

434
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,340
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

435
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,380
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up--

436
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,260
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

437
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,540
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

438
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,380
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

439
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,100
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

440
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,300
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

441
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,380
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

442
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,020
-Getting himself killed.
-Keep tarring.

443
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,660
Some brother.
Shit!

444
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,740
Mr. Hadley...

445
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,860
...do you trust your wife?

446
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,860
Oh, that's funny.

447
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,860
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

448
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,260
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

449
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,620
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

450
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
He'll push him off!

451
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,820
If you trust her, you can keep...

452
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,380
...that 35,000.

453
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,460
-What did you say?
-Thirty-five thousand.

454
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,260
All of it.

455
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,420
-Every penny.
-You better start making sense.

456
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,820
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

457
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,780
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

458
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,260
-Bullshit. Tax-free?
-Tax-free.

459
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,300
IRS can't touch one cent.

460
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,060
You're that smart banker
that killed his wife.

461
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,540
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

462
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,460
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

463
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,540
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

464
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,220
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

465
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,740
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

466
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,420
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

467
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,740
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

468
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,540
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

469
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,740
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

470
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,620
...nearly free of charge.

471
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,940
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

472
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,380
"Coworkers." That's rich!

473
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,580
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

474
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,100
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

475
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,500
...sir.

476
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,140
What are you jimmies staring at?

477
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,820
Let's go! Work!

478
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,820
And that's how it came to pass...

479
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:11,540
...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

480
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,180
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

481
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,340
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

482
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,780
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

483
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,140
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

484
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,660
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

485
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,060
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

486
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,460
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

487
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,140
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

488
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,060
We were the lords of all creation.

489
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,100
As for Andy...

490
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,820
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

491
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,460
...a strange little smile on his face...

492
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,780
...watching us drink his beer.

493
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,860
Want a cold one?

494
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,340
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

495
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,100
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

496
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,420
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

497
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,140
Me?

498
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,020
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

499
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,540
...if only for a short while.

500
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,140
King me.

501
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,460
-Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
-What?

502
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,340
Civilized. Strategic.

503
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,860
And a total fucking mystery.
I hate it.

504
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,820
Let me teach you someday.

505
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,220
Sure.

506
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,340
We could get a board together.

507
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,500
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

508
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:55,540
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

509
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,900
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

510
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,820
I think it'll take years.

511
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,460
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

512
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,540
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

513
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,500
Pebbles, mostly.

514
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,300
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

515
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,660
Yeah, I guess.

516
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,740
Can I ask you something?

517
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,540
Why'd you do it?

518
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,220
I'm innocent, Red.

519
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,380
Just like everybody else here.

520
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,020
What are you in for?

521
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,700
Murder. Same as you.

522
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,020
Innocent?

523
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,900
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

524
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,260
Where's the canary?

525
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,700
How did you know?

526
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,060
-How did I know what?
-So you don't know.

527
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,380
Come.

528
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,780
This is where the canary is.

529
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,580
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

530
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,260
That's quite a...

531
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,780
...surprise.

532
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,260
Wait, wait.

533
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,220
Here she comes.

534
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,180
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

535
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,020
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

536
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,020
Gilda, are you decent?

537
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,060
Me?

538
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,340
God, I love it.

539
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,180
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

540
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,740
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

541
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,980
-Rita Hayworth.
-What?

542
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,860
Can you get her?

543
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,420
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

544
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,820
-Take a few weeks.
-Weeks?

545
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,260
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

546
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,060
But I'll get her.

547
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,540
Relax.

548
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,580
Thanks.

549
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,020
-Get out!
-I got to change reels!

550
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,140
I said fuck off!

551
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,340
Ain't you going to scream?

552
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,420
Let's get this over with.

553
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,220
He broke my fucking nose!

554
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,380
Now...

555
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,900
...I'm going to open my fly...

556
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,780
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

557
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,380
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

558
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,620
He ought to have
something to show for it.

559
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,620
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

560
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,300
No, you don't understand.

561
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,500
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

562
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:14,020
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

563
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,100
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

564
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,620
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

565
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,780
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

566
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,300
...with a crowbar.

567
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,580
Where do you get this shit?

568
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,140
I read it.

569
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,020
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

570
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,700
Honey!

571
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,220
You shouldn't!

572
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,580
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

573
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,780
And neither did his friends.

574
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,900
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

575
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,940
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

576
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,100
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

577
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,540
Time's up, Bogs.

578
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:08,740
It's your world, boss.

579
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:14,580
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

580
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,340
All prisoners report for lock down.

581
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,660
What?

582
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,180
-Where's he going?
-Grab his ankles.

583
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:53,980
Help!

584
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,980
Two things never happened again
after that.

585
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,260
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

586
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,420
And Bogs would never walk again.

587
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,940
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

588
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,820
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

589
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,740
...drinking his food through a straw.

590
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,620
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

591
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,820
Sounds good to us.

592
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,460
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

593
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,340
The man likes to play chess.

594
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,660
Let's get him some rocks.

595
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,140
Guys!

596
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,860
I got one.

597
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,500
I got one. Look!

598
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,220
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

599
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,260
What are you, a fucking geologist?

600
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,100
He's right. It ain't.

601
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,100
-What the hell is it then?
-It's a horse apple.

602
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,300
-Bullshit!
-No, horseshit.

603
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,940
Petrified.

604
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,700
Damn!

605
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:39,100
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

606
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:41,140
And by the weekend
he was due back...

607
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,900
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

608
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,140
Also got a big shipment in that week.

609
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,460
Cigarettes...

610
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,620
...chewing gum...

611
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:52,220
...sipping whisky...

612
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,700
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

613
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,540
And of course, the most important item:

614
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,300
Rita Hayworth herself.

615
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,060
Heads up.
They're tossing cells.

616
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,820
Heads up.
They're tossing cells!

617
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,820
119.

618
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,180
123.

619
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,980
On your feet.

620
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,940
Face the wall.

621
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,540
Turn around and face the warden.

622
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,820
Pleased to see you reading this.

623
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,980
Any favorite passages?

624
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,060
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

625
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,420
...when the master
of the house cometh."

626
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,580
Mark 1 3:35.

627
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,100
I've always liked that one.

628
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,580
But I prefer...

629
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,820
..."l am the light of the world.

630
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,420
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

631
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,140
John, chapter 8, verse 1 2.

632
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,380
I hear you're good with numbers.

633
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,500
How nice.

634
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,540
Man should have a skill.

635
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,980
Explain this.

636
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,980
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

637
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,260
A little hobby of mine.

638
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,060
It's pretty clean.

639
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,300
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

640
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,340
I can't say I approve of this.

641
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,340
But I suppose...

642
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,220
...exceptions can be made.

643
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,460
Lock them up!

644
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,740
I almost forgot.

645
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,260
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

646
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,820
Salvation lies within.

647
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,060
Yes, sir.

648
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,660
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

649
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,340
Truth is...

650
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,900
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

651
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,220
My wife made that in church group.

652
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,020
Very nice, sir.

653
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:55,940
You enjoy working the laundry?

654
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,180
No, sir. Not especially.

655
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,860
Perhaps we can find something more...

656
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,420
...befitting a man of your education.

657
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,620
Hey, Jake.
Where's Brooks?

658
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:18,060
I thought I heard you out here.

659
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,180
I've been reassigned to you.

660
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:22,700
I know, they told me.

661
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,460
Ain't that a kick in the head?

662
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,860
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

663
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:29,180
Come on.

664
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,220
Well, here she is.

665
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,260
The Shawshank Prison Library.

666
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,860
National Geographics...

667
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,420
... Reader's Digest condensed books...

668
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,140
...and Louis L'Amour.

669
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,420
Look magazine.

670
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,020
Erle Stanley Gardners.

671
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,580
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

672
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:53,340
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

673
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,460
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

674
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,940
-Any questions?
-How long have you been librarian?

675
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,980
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1 9 1 2.

676
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,260
And have you ever had an assistant?

677
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,820
No. Not much to it, really.

678
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:12,740
Why me? Why now?

679
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,420
I don't know.

680
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:17,500
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

681
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,500
That's him.
That's the one.

682
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,940
I'm Dekins.

683
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,900
I was thinking...

684
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,300
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

685
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,420
I see.

686
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,180
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

687
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,060
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

688
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,180
Thanks.

689
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,900
So....

690
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,220
Mister Dekins....

691
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,060
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

692
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,140
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

693
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:28,340
He didn't say that!

694
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,060
As God as my witness!

695
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,020
Dekins blinked for a second...

696
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,180
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

697
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,780
-My ass!
-Shook his hand.

698
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,780
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

699
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,100
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

700
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,780
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

701
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,540
Making a few friends?

702
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,380
I wouldn't say "friends."

703
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:57,260
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

704
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,660
It's a wonderful pet to have.

705
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,580
Got you out of the laundry, though.

706
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,940
It might do more than that.

707
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,780
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

708
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,460
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

709
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,940
How do you expect to do that?
I mean...

710
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:17,020
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

711
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,420
I'll ask the warden for funds.

712
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:24,340
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

713
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,780
...one immutable, universal truth:

714
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,340
Not one born whose asshole...

715
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:33,260
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

716
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,860
-The budget's stretched thin as it is.
-I see.

717
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,380
Maybe I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

718
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,500
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

719
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,060
More walls, more bars, more guards.

720
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,780
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

721
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,620
-They can't ignore me forever.
-Sure can.

722
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,420
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

723
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,220
I'll even mail them for you.
How's that?

724
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,500
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

725
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,220
...just like he said.

726
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,740
And like Norton said...

727
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:12,340
...Andy got no answers.

728
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,940
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

729
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,380
Year after that, he did them all...

730
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,460
...including the warden's.

731
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,460
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

732
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:37,980
...to coincide with tax season.

733
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:43,780
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

734
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,220
So Moresby Prison...

735
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,620
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

736
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,460
Right. The holster too.

737
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,020
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

738
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,140
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

739
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:00,100
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

740
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,780
Could you hand me
a stack of 1 040s?

741
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,580
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

742
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:11,780
And still, he kept
sending those letters.

743
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,300
It's Brooks.

744
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,780
Watch the door.

745
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,340
Please, Brooks.

746
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,340
-Calm the fuck down.
-Stay back!

747
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,220
-Stay back, goddamn it!
-What's going on?

748
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,900
One second he's fine,
then out come the knives.

749
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,860
We can talk about this, right?

750
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,660
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

751
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,580
What's he done to you?

752
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,380
It's what they done!

753
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,100
I got no choice.

754
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,740
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

755
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,300
-Right, Heywood?
-Sure.

756
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,700
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

757
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,020
Right, guys?

758
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,340
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

759
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,740
Put the knife down.

760
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,580
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

761
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,540
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

762
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,820
It's the only way...

763
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,980
...they'd let me stay.

764
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,500
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

765
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,740
Put it, put it down.

766
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,540
Take it easy.

767
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,700
You'll be all right.

768
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,220
Him? What about me?

769
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,740
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

770
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,780
You've had worse from shaving.

771
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,940
What did you do to set him off?

772
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:37,300
Nothing.
I come in here to say farewell.

773
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,420
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

774
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,380
I just don't understand
what happened in there.

775
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,260
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

776
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:50,260
That's enough out of you.

777
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,100
-Heard he had you shitting your pants.
-Fuck you.

778
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,460
Knock it off.

779
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:56,780
Brooks ain't no bug.

780
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,180
He's just institutionalized.

781
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,340
"Institutionalized," my ass.

782
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:09,340
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

783
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,220
This is all he knows.

784
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,620
In here, he's an important man...

785
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,900
...an educated man.

786
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,500
Outside, he's nothing.

787
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:21,660
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

788
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,740
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

789
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,700
You know what I'm trying to say?

790
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,740
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

791
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,060
You believe whatever you want.

792
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,980
But I tell you these walls are funny.

793
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,100
First you hate them.

794
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,700
Then you get used to them.

795
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,460
Enough time passes...

796
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,020
...you get so you depend on them.

797
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:52,100
That's "institutionalized."

798
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,500
Shit.

799
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,380
-I could never get like that.
-Oh, yeah?

800
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,620
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

801
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,340
Goddamn right.

802
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,660
They send you here for life...

803
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,540
...that's exactly what they take.

804
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,100
Part that counts, anyway.

805
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,260
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

806
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,940
You go on now.

807
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,580
You're free.

808
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,300
You're free.

809
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,140
Good luck, Brooksie.

810
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,980
Dear fellas:

811
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:32,300
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

812
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,100
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

813
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,620
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

814
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,580
...but now they're everywhere.

815
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:51,220
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

816
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:10,020
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

817
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,900
...called "The Brewer"...

818
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,180
...and a job...

819
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,260
...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

820
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,060
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

821
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,500
...but my hands hurt most of the time.

822
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,700
Make sure your man double-bags.

823
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,860
Last time, the bottom near came out.

824
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,300
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

825
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,780
Yes, sir. Surely will.

826
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:35,380
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

827
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:42,380
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

828
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,260
I keep thinking...

829
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,660
...Jake might just show up
and say hello.

830
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,180
But he never does.

831
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,980
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

832
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,060
I have trouble sleeping at night.

833
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:05,500
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

834
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,900
I wake up scared.

835
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:12,140
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

836
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:18,300
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

837
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:22,740
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

838
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:28,180
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

839
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,060
I don't like it here.

840
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:34,100
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

841
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,500
...not to stay.

842
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:49,420
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

843
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,980
...not for an old crook like me.

844
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,980
"l doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

845
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:01,660
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

846
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,100
No hard feelings. Brooks."

847
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,020
He should have died in here.

848
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,700
What the fuck have you done?

849
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,420
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

850
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,300
-What's all this?
-You tell me. They're addressed to you.

851
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,820
Take it.

852
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,460
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

853
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,420
In response to your inquiries...

854
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:53,740
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

855
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,220
This is $200.

856
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:00,260
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

857
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:02,900
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

858
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,060
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

859
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,980
Please stop sending us letters."

860
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,740
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

861
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,100
Yes, sir.

862
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:18,300
Good for you, Andy.

863
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:22,260
Wow!

864
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,260
It only took six years.

865
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,420
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

866
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:32,780
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

867
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:33,860
...like he said.

868
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:35,380
I've got to pinch a loaf.

869
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,020
When I come back...

870
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:38,900
...this is all gone, all right?

871
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,980
Do you hear that?

872
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,020
Dufresne!

873
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,900
Andy, let me out!

874
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:49,220
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

875
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,700
Truth is, I don't want to know.

876
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,260
Some things are best left unsaid.

877
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,300
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

878
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,540
...it can't be expressed in words...

879
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,540
...and makes your heart ache
because of it.

880
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,540
I tell you, those voices soared...

881
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,900
...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

882
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:17,340
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

883
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,180
...and made those walls dissolve away.

884
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,740
And for the briefest of moments...

885
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,780
...every last man at Shawshank
felt free.

886
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,820
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

887
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:33,020
Open the door.

888
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,500
Open it up!

889
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:41,380
Dufresne, open this door!

890
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:43,780
Turn that off!

891
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,900
I am warning you. Turn that off!

892
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,420
You're mine now.

893
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:21,660
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

894
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:23,380
On your feet.

895
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,780
-Hey, look who's here.
-Maestro!

896
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:31,980
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

897
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:34,980
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

898
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,180
-Was it worth two weeks?
-Easiest time I ever did.

899
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:42,380
-No such thing as easy time in the hole.
-A week in the hole is like a year.

900
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,780
-Damn straight.
-I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

901
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,820
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

902
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:52,460
It was in here.

903
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,460
In here.

904
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,540
That's the beauty of music. They...

905
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,980
...can't get that from you.

906
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,660
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

907
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:10,380
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

908
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,020
Lost interest in it, though.

909
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,740
Didn't make much sense in here.

910
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,980
Here's where it makes the most sense.

911
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:19,460
You need it so you don't forget.

912
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:21,180
Forget?

913
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:24,500
Forget that there are...

914
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,060
...places...

915
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:30,220
...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

916
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:32,620
There's something...

917
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:34,300
...inside...

918
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:36,460
...that they can't get to...

919
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,940
...that they can't touch.

920
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:39,820
That's yours.

921
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,820
What are you talking about?

922
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:45,020
Hope.

923
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,300
Hope.

924
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,060
Let me tell you something, my friend.

925
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,060
Hope is a dangerous thing.

926
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,480
Hope can drive a man insane.

927
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,200
It's got no use on the inside.

928
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,520
You'd better get used to that idea.

929
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,360
Like Brooks did?

930
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,640
Sit down.

931
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,960
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

932
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:43,040
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

933
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,400
Oh, yes, sir.

934
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:46,960
Without a doubt.

935
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,360
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

936
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,120
No danger to society here.

937
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,120
God's honest truth.

938
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,600
Absolutely rehabilitated.

939
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,440
Thirty years.

940
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,160
Jesus, when you say it like that....

941
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,720
You wonder where it went.

942
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,120
I wonder where 1 0 years went.

943
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,920
Here.

944
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,960
A little parole rejection present.

945
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,800
Go ahead and open it.

946
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,760
Went through one of your competitors.

947
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

948
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,040
It's very pretty.

949
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:53,840
Thank you.

950
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,720
You going to play it?

951
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,320
No.

952
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,120
Not right now.

953
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,160
Roll in!

954
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,040
Lights out!

955
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:37,280
Andy was as good as his word.

956
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,280
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

957
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:46,200
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

958
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,440
...they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

959
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,760
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

960
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:55,760
...just to shut him up.

961
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,840
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

962
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:01,840
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

963
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,680
He bought remaindered books
by the pound....

964
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,640
Treasure Island.

965
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,440
Robert Louis--

966
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,600
Stevenson.

967
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,160
Fiction, adventure.

968
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,600
What's next?

969
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,720
I got here Auto Repair...

970
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:19,560
...and Soap Carving.

971
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:22,840
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

972
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,840
Count of Monte Crisco.

973
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,480
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

974
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,480
By Alexandree...

975
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,160
...Dum-ass.

976
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,480
Dumb ass.

977
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,680
Dumb ass?

978
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,360
Dumas. Know what that's about?

979
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,440
You'd like it.
It's about a prison break.

980
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,400
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

981
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:53,160
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

982
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:55,360
By the year Kennedy was shot...

983
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,920
...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

984
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,200
...into the best prison library
in New England...

985
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,680
...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

986
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,640
That was also when Warden Norton...

987
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,600
...instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

988
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,040
You may remember reading about it.

989
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:24,240
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

990
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,680
It's no free ride...

991
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,960
..but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

992
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,600
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

993
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,320
Our inmates, properly supervised...

994
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,040
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

995
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,680
...performing all manner
of public service.

996
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,040
These men can learn the value...

997
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,880
...of an honest day's labor and
provide a service to the community...

998
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,600
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

999
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,240
Of course he didn't tell the press...

1000
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,800
...that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1001
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,880
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1002
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,480
Men, materials, you name it.

1003
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,560
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1004
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,200
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1005
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,680
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1006
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,040
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1007
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,760
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1008
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,800
We go back a long way.

1009
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,760
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1010
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,400
You have some of this fine pie...

1011
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,800
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1012
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,320
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1013
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,480
I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1014
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,320
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1015
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,480
And behind every shady deal...

1016
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,320
...behind every dollar earned...

1017
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,480
...there was Andy, keeping the books.

1018
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,120
Two deposits.

1019
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,280
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1020
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:43,440
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1021
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,280
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1022
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:48,720
How do I look?

1023
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,120
-Very nice.
-Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1024
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,800
Governor will be there.

1025
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,560
You want the rest of this?

1026
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,680
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1027
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:02,160
Thank you, sir.

1028
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,960
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1029
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,800
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1030
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,280
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1031
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,160
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1032
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,040
That's where I come in.

1033
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,800
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1034
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,720
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1035
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,440
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back....

1036
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,440
-Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
-Cleaner.

1037
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,480
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1038
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,880
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1039
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:46,720
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1040
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,840
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1041
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,280
Now anybody gets curious,
FBI, IRS...

1042
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,440
...whatever.

1043
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,120
It'll lead to somebody.

1044
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,040
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1045
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,200
All right, who?

1046
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,920
Randall Stevens.

1047
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,320
Who?

1048
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,440
The "silent" silent partner.

1049
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,560
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1050
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,840
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1051
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,760
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1052
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,520
But who is he?

1053
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,520
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1054
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:26,720
I conjured him...

1055
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,240
...out of thin air.

1056
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,600
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1057
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,840
You can't just make a person up.

1058
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,960
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1059
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,200
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1060
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,040
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1061
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,280
...driver's license, Social Security.

1062
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,480
You're shitting me.

1063
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,960
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1064
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,800
...a figment of my imagination.

1065
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,880
Well, I'll be damned!

1066
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,840
Did I say you were good?

1067
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,760
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1068
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,120
The funny thing is...

1069
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:08,240
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1070
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,840
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1071
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,640
Ever bother you?

1072
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:24,920
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1073
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,120
A fine line, maybe...

1074
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,640
...but I also built that library...

1075
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,760
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1076
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,120
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1077
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:37,400
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1078
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,000
Money instead of sheets.

1079
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,840
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1080
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,920
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1081
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,280
...on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1082
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,760
That's breaking and entering to you.

1083
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:10,080
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1084
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,720
Young punk.

1085
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,520
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1086
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,160
...cocky as hell.

1087
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,640
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1088
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:19,560
Making me look bad.

1089
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,480
We liked him immediately.

1090
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:25,320
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1091
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,080
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1092
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,560
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1093
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,040
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1094
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:39,880
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1095
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:43,440
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1096
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,920
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1097
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:54,200
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1098
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,320
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

1099
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:57,560
Not like here.

1100
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,080
Sounds like you done time all over.

1101
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,800
I've been in and out since I was 1 3.

1102
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,080
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1103
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,840
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1104
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,680
What I mean is...

1105
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,360
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1106
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,640
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1107
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,560
What are you in for?

1108
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:20,800
Me?

1109
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,720
A lawyer fucked me.

1110
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,320
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1111
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,160
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1112
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,720
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1113
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,280
...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1114
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:49,920
Whatever it was...

1115
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,600
...something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1116
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,000
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1117
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,600
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1118
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,040
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1119
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,760
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1120
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,240
-You mean that?
-Yeah.

1121
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,200
You really mean that?

1122
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,480
Yes, sir, I do.

1123
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,600
Good. Because if we do this...

1124
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:23,600
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1125
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,560
Thing is, see...

1126
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,240
...I don't read so good.

1127
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,360
"Well."

1128
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,000
You don't read...

1129
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:35,680
...so well.

1130
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,360
We'll get to that.

1131
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,640
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1132
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,360
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1133
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,560
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1134
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,480
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1135
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,000
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1136
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,800
He really liked the kid.

1137
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,400
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1138
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,040
But that wasn't the only reason.

1139
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,840
Prison time is slow time.

1140
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,760
So you do what you can to keep going.

1141
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,080
Some fellas collect stamps.

1142
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,840
Others build matchstick houses.

1143
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:22,960
Andy built a library.

1144
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,320
Now he needed a new project.

1145
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:27,560
Tommy was it.

1146
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,040
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1147
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,640
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1148
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:37,720
In prison...

1149
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:41,560
...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1150
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:47,000
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1151
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:49,280
...it was lovely Raquel.

1152
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,120
Time.

1153
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,880
Well?

1154
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,480
Well, it's for shit.

1155
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,680
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1156
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,320
It's probably not that bad.

1157
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,560
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1158
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,400
Let's see how the score comes out.

1159
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,440
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1160
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,640
Two points, right there!

1161
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,320
There's your goddamn score!

1162
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:39,080
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25....

1163
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,560
Fuck this place!

1164
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:42,880
Fuck it!

1165
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,440
I feel bad.

1166
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:03,800
I let him down.

1167
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,680
That's crap, kid.

1168
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,120
He's proud of you.

1169
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:10,200
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1170
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,880
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1171
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,120
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1172
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,440
What's he in here for anyway?

1173
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,680
Murder.

1174
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,400
The hell, you say.

1175
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,680
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1176
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,800
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1177
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,480
What?

1178
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:43,200
About four years ago...

1179
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:46,560
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1180
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,280
I stole a car.

1181
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:50,560
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1182
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,360
About six months left to go...

1183
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,440
...I get a new cellmate in.

1184
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,680
Elmo Blatch.

1185
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,640
Big, twitchy fucker.

1186
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:03,800
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1187
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,640
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1188
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,080
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1189
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:14,040
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1190
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:19,480
Talked all the time too. That's
the other thing. He never shut up.

1191
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,240
Places he'd been in...

1192
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:24,440
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1193
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,800
Even people he killed.

1194
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,680
People who "gave him shit."

1195
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,800
That's how he put it.

1196
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,280
So one night, like a joke...

1197
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,680
...I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1198
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:42,960
So he says:

1199
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,960
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1200
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:51,360
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1201
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:55,320
So I pick out this guy...

1202
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,640
...go in one night...

1203
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:59,520
...and do his place.

1204
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,160
He wakes up...

1205
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,600
...and gives me shit.

1206
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,200
So I killed him.

1207
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:11,600
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1208
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,120
And that's the best part.

1209
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,120
She's fucking this prick, see...

1210
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:21,280
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1211
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,320
Some hotshot banker.

1212
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:28,120
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1213
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,840
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1214
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,440
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1215
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,040
Sir?

1216
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:53,640
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1217
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:58,040
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1218
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,280
He's young, not terribly bright.

1219
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,080
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1220
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,960
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1221
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,720
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1222
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,400
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1223
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:18,200
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1224
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,080
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1225
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,640
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1226
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,720
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1227
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,280
They'd have his last known address.

1228
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,320
It's a chance, isn't it?

1229
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,240
How can you be so obtuse?

1230
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,080
What?

1231
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,960
What did you call me?

1232
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,800
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1233
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,600
You're forgetting yourself.

1234
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,760
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1235
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,600
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1236
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,360
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1237
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,040
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1238
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,720
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1239
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,200
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1240
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,800
Don't ever mention money to me,
you son of a bitch!

1241
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,560
Not in this office...

1242
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,640
...not anywhere.
Get in here, now!

1243
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,440
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1244
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,280
Solitary. A month.

1245
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:15,480
What's wrong with you?

1246
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,920
Get him out of here.

1247
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,600
This is my chance to get out!

1248
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:20,520
It's my life! Understand?!

1249
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,720
Get him out!

1250
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,280
A month in the hole.

1251
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,080
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1252
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,520
It's all my fault.

1253
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:32,240
Bullshit.

1254
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,480
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1255
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,000
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1256
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,120
I mean, for real innocent?

1257
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,600
It looks that way.

1258
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:43,840
Sweet Jesus.

1259
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,840
How long has he been here now?

1260
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:49,400
1 947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

1261
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:52,080
-Williams, Thomas.
-Yeah, over here.

1262
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,840
What you got?

1263
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:00,720
Board of Education.

1264
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,360
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1265
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,360
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1266
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,640
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1267
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:11,840
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1268
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:13,880
Floyd, come on.

1269
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,400
Will you throw that away, please?

1270
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:28,480
Well, shit.

1271
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,320
The kid passed. C + average.

1272
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,520
Thought you'd like to know.

1273
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,520
Warden wants to talk.

1274
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,680
Out here?

1275
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,040
That's what the man said.

1276
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:35,440
Warden?

1277
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:48,960
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1278
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,560
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1279
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,240
We got a situation here.

1280
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:15,080
I think you can appreciate that.

1281
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,480
Yes, sir.

1282
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,080
I sure can.

1283
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:22,200
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1284
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,040
It's got me up nights.
That's the truth.

1285
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,000
The right thing to do...

1286
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,200
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1287
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,520
Do you understand?

1288
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,280
I need your help, son.

1289
01:33:42,680 --> 01:33:44,720
If I'm going to move on this...

1290
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:48,080
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1291
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:49,800
I have to know...

1292
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:52,520
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1293
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:53,840
Yes, sir.

1294
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,200
Absolutely.

1295
01:33:55,680 --> 01:33:58,560
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1296
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,640
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1297
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,400
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1298
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,320
Just give me that chance.

1299
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:10,720
That's what I thought.

1300
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,720
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1301
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,400
Terrible thing.

1302
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:03,320
A man that young...

1303
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:06,160
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1304
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,040
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1305
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:11,200
Truly, it did.

1306
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,440
We just have to put it behind us.

1307
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,200
Move on.

1308
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:22,160
I'm done.

1309
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,960
Everything stops.

1310
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:29,120
Get someone else to run your scams.

1311
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,080
Nothing stops.

1312
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:34,480
Nothing.

1313
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,760
Or you will do
the hardest time there is.

1314
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:43,320
No more protection from the guards.

1315
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:48,280
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1316
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,960
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1317
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,720
And the library?

1318
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:56,320
Gone.

1319
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,360
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1320
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:02,360
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1321
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,600
They'll see the flames for miles.

1322
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,520
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1323
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,600
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1324
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,000
Or am I being obtuse?

1325
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:30,800
Give him another month
to think about it.

1326
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:18,560
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1327
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,080
Like a closed book.

1328
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,800
Complained about it all the time.

1329
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:26,240
She was beautiful.

1330
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,000
God, I loved her.

1331
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:35,720
I didn't know how
to show it, that's all.

1332
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,920
I killed her, Red.

1333
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,480
I didn't pull the trigger...

1334
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,480
...but I drove her away.

1335
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:50,520
That's why she died, because of me...

1336
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,000
...the way I am.

1337
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,400
That don't make you a murderer.

1338
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,360
Bad husband, maybe.

1339
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,960
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1340
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:15,440
No, I didn't.

1341
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,680
Somebody else did.

1342
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,920
And I wound up in here.

1343
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:24,760
Bad luck, I guess.

1344
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:31,200
It floats around.

1345
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,280
It's got to land on somebody.

1346
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,960
It was my turn, that's all.

1347
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,320
I was in the path of the tornado.

1348
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:49,840
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1349
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:55,600
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1350
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:57,760
Me?

1351
01:39:00,640 --> 01:39:01,600
Yeah.

1352
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,080
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1353
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,320
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

1354
01:39:10,280 --> 01:39:11,840
I tell you where I'd go.

1355
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,840
Zihuatanejo.

1356
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:16,840
Say what?

1357
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,880
Zihuatanejo.

1358
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,360
It's in Mexico.

1359
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:24,720
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1360
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,480
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1361
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,120
They say it has no memory.

1362
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,600
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1363
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,560
A warm place with no memory.

1364
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:45,520
Open up a little hotel...

1365
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,600
...right on the beach.

1366
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:51,280
Buy some worthless old boat...

1367
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:53,360
...and fix it up new.

1368
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,200
Take my guests out...

1369
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,280
...charter fishing.

1370
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,640
Zihuatanejo.

1371
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,720
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1372
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,760
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1373
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,120
I been in here most of my life.

1374
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:32,160
I'm an institutional man now.

1375
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,720
Just like Brooks was.

1376
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:37,720
You underestimate yourself.

1377
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,800
I don't think so.

1378
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:47,280
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1379
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,440
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1380
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,760
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1381
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,400
Pacific Ocean?

1382
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,000
Shit.

1383
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,440
Scare me to death,
something that big.

1384
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:01,880
Not me.

1385
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,720
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1386
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,480
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1387
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,880
That hotel, that boat....

1388
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,720
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1389
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,760
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1390
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,920
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1391
01:41:26,360 --> 01:41:28,680
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1392
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,360
...and that's the way it is.

1393
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:33,440
Yeah, right.
That's the way it is.

1394
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,200
It's down there and I'm in here.

1395
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,280
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1396
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:46,480
Get busy living...

1397
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,760
...or get busy dying.

1398
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:03,960
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1399
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,360
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1400
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:11,880
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1401
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:16,280
-A lot of hayfields up there.
-One in particular.

1402
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,240
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1403
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:23,200
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1404
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:26,480
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1405
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,840
We went there for a picnic...

1406
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:32,240
...and made love under that oak...

1407
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,040
...and I asked and she said yes.

1408
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,640
Promise me, Red.

1409
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,000
If you ever get out...

1410
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,640
...find that spot.

1411
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,400
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1412
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:54,400
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1413
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,520
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1414
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:01,440
What, Andy?

1415
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:03,520
What's buried under there?

1416
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,840
You'll have to pry it up...

1417
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,240
...to see.

1418
01:43:13,880 --> 01:43:15,800
No, I'm telling you. The guy is....

1419
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,080
He's talking funny.

1420
01:43:19,120 --> 01:43:20,760
I'm really worried about him.

1421
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:22,520
Let's keep an eye on him.

1422
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:25,840
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1423
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,280
Oh, Lord.

1424
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:30,400
What?

1425
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:34,520
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1426
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,680
He asked me for a length of rope.

1427
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:37,680
Rope?

1428
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:39,480
Six feet long.

1429
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,040
And you gave it to him.

1430
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,560
Sure. Why wouldn't l?

1431
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:45,240
Jesus! Heywood.

1432
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,760
How was I supposed to know?

1433
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,440
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1434
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,240
Andy would never do that.

1435
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:54,800
Never.

1436
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,080
I don't know.

1437
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,760
Every man has his breaking point.

1438
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,160
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

1439
01:44:07,480 --> 01:44:09,160
Just about finished, sir.

1440
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:27,160
Three deposits tonight.

1441
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:36,600
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1442
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,360
And shine my shoes.

1443
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:41,360
-I want them looking like mirrors.
-Yes, sir.

1444
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:48,040
It's good having you back.

1445
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:50,720
Place wasn't the same without you.

1446
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:36,720
Lights out!

1447
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:10,640
I've had some long nights in stir.

1448
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:13,720
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1449
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:16,480
...time can draw out like a blade.

1450
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:24,440
That was the longest night of my life.

1451
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,800
Give me a count!

1452
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,840
Tier 3 south, clear!

1453
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:53,880
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1454
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,120
Dufresne!

1455
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:57,920
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1456
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:04,240
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1457
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,160
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1458
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,520
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1459
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:20,000
You hear me?

1460
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,880
Oh, my Holy God.

1461
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:46,640
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1462
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,480
-Start with that friend of his.
-Who?

1463
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,440
Open 237.

1464
01:47:56,840 --> 01:48:00,360
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1465
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,480
Don't tell me that again.

1466
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:03,640
But sir, he wasn't.

1467
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:07,200
I can see that, Haig!
Think I'm blind?

1468
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:09,160
Is that what you're saying?

1469
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,920
-Am I blind, Haig?
-No, sir!

1470
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,200
What about you. You blind?

1471
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:18,120
-Tell me what this is.
-Last night's count.

1472
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:21,480
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1473
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:23,000
"Dufresne."

1474
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:25,960
He was in his cell...

1475
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:27,120
...at lights out.

1476
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:29,520
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1477
01:48:30,520 --> 01:48:32,040
I want him found.

1478
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:35,560
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1479
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:36,960
Yes, sir.

1480
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,080
Let's go. Move your butts.

1481
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,320
Stand.

1482
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:46,680
Well?

1483
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:50,960
Well, what?

1484
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:54,480
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1485
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,920
He must have said something.

1486
01:48:57,680 --> 01:48:59,120
No, sir, Warden.

1487
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:00,440
Not a word.

1488
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:04,640
Lord, it's a miracle!

1489
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:07,680
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1490
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,440
Nothing left...

1491
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:12,840
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1492
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:15,640
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1493
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,560
Maybe she knows.

1494
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:20,400
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1495
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,040
Guess not.

1496
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,680
Why should she be any different?

1497
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,320
This is a conspiracy.

1498
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,680
That's what this is.

1499
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:34,840
One big, damn conspiracy!

1500
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:37,040
And everyone's in on it!

1501
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:38,760
Including her!

1502
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:13,960
In 1966...

1503
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:16,480
...Andy Dufresne escaped...

1504
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:18,160
...from Shawshank Prison.

1505
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,800
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1506
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,880
...a bar of soap...

1507
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,560
...and an old rock hammer...

1508
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,120
...damn near worn down to the nub.

1509
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:38,040
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

1510
01:50:38,640 --> 01:50:41,120
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1511
01:50:58,680 --> 01:51:00,880
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1512
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:04,640
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

1513
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:06,800
An ice age here...

1514
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:09,640
...million years
of mountain building there.

1515
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,320
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1516
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,040
That's all it takes, really.

1517
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:17,760
Pressure...

1518
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,600
...and time.

1519
01:51:20,920 --> 01:51:22,880
That and a big goddamn poster.

1520
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,640
Like I said...

1521
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:31,960
...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1522
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:39,240
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1523
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,640
...a handful at a time.

1524
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,840
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1525
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:47,920
...Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1526
01:51:48,120 --> 01:51:50,560
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

1527
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:53,200
I'm just about finished, sir.

1528
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:15,640
Three deposits tonight.

1529
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,840
Andy did like he was told.

1530
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,400
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1531
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,160
The guards simply didn't notice.

1532
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:35,840
Neither did l.

1533
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:37,480
I mean, seriously...

1534
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:40,560
...how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1535
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,120
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1536
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:45,520
...of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1537
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,720
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1538
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,240
Five hundred yards.

1539
01:54:55,680 --> 01:54:58,640
That's the length
of five football fields.

1540
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:01,720
Just shy of half a mile.

1541
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:59,120
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1542
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:02,080
...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1543
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,840
...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1544
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:08,400
Until that moment,
he didn't exist.

1545
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:11,240
-Except on paper.
-May I help you?

1546
01:56:11,600 --> 01:56:13,440
He had all the proper ID...

1547
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:17,200
...driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card....

1548
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:20,040
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1549
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:23,240
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1550
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,080
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1551
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:26,880
Thank you.

1552
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,640
I'm sure I will.

1553
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,720
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1554
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:33,880
Please.

1555
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:36,800
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1556
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:38,480
I'd be happy to.

1557
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:41,440
Good day, sir.

1558
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:46,640
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1559
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,600
All told, he blew town...

1560
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:53,440
...with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1561
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:56,760
Severance pay for 19 years.

1562
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:05,800
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1563
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:59,320
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1564
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:03,840
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1565
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:08,520
I wasn't there to see, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1566
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,160
...when they took him away.

1567
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:19,040
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1568
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:35,040
Samuel Norton.

1569
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,160
We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.

1570
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:43,760
Open the door.

1571
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:45,480
I'm not sure which key.

1572
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,080
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1573
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:11,440
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1574
01:59:11,640 --> 01:59:13,160
...other than that bullet...

1575
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:17,640
...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1576
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:23,360
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1577
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:25,560
...I got a postcard in the mail.

1578
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,720
It was blank,
but the postmark said...

1579
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,960
...Fort Hancock, Texas.

1580
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:33,760
Fort Hancock...

1581
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,680
...right on the border.

1582
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:38,000
That's where Andy crossed.

1583
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:42,520
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1584
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:44,960
...it always makes me laugh.

1585
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:48,240
Andy Dufresne...

1586
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:50,560
...who crawled through
a river of shit...

1587
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:53,040
...and came out clean
on the other side.

1588
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:55,160
Andy Dufresne...

1589
01:59:55,960 --> 01:59:57,440
...headed for the Pacific.

1590
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,400
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1591
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:06,240
He says, "l believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1592
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:09,200
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1593
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,440
I swear, the stuff he pulled....

1594
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:14,480
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1595
02:00:14,840 --> 02:00:16,400
And he got it!

1596
02:00:17,600 --> 02:00:19,880
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1597
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:21,520
...Andy being gone.

1598
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:26,200
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1599
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,600
Their feathers are just too bright.

1600
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:31,880
And when they fly away...

1601
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:36,520
...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1602
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:38,760
But still...

1603
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:43,360
...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1604
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,680
I guess I just miss my friend.

1605
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:14,280
Please sit down.

1606
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:21,360
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1607
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:25,040
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1608
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,840
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1609
02:01:29,640 --> 02:01:31,120
Rehabilitated?

1610
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:34,920
Well, now, let me see.

1611
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:38,120
I don't have any idea
what that means.

1612
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,280
It means you're ready
to rejoin society--

1613
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:45,080
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1614
02:01:47,160 --> 02:01:49,080
To me it's just a made-up word.

1615
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:52,600
A politician's word so that...

1616
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:56,400
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1617
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,400
...and have a job.

1618
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:02,280
What do you really want to know?

1619
02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:04,920
Am I sorry for what I did?

1620
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,440
Well, are you?

1621
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:11,000
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1622
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,640
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1623
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:21,400
I look back on the way I was then...

1624
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:24,600
...a young...

1625
02:02:25,680 --> 02:02:29,000
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1626
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:33,560
I want to talk to him.

1627
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:37,760
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1628
02:02:38,440 --> 02:02:40,320
Tell him the way things are.

1629
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,720
But I can't.

1630
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:47,720
That kid's long gone...

1631
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:51,520
...and this old man is all that's left.

1632
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:54,280
I got to live with that.

1633
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:57,240
Rehabilitated?

1634
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,360
It's just a bullshit word.

1635
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:04,840
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1636
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,200
Because to tell you the truth...

1637
02:03:08,520 --> 02:03:10,400
...I don't give a shit.

1638
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,760
Here you go, miss.

1639
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:38,560
Restroom break?

1640
02:04:44,120 --> 02:04:48,440
You don't need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1641
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,920
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1642
02:05:04,720 --> 02:05:07,600
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1643
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,040
There's a harsh truth to face.

1644
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:17,440
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1645
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:28,560
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1646
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:31,680
...so maybe they'd send me back.

1647
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,000
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1648
02:05:39,880 --> 02:05:41,480
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1649
02:05:41,680 --> 02:05:43,520
Knew it all too well.

1650
02:05:45,040 --> 02:05:48,320
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1651
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:51,320
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1652
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,560
Only one thing stops me.

1653
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:59,240
A promise I made to Andy.

1654
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:20,000
There it is.

1655
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:31,760
Much obliged, sir.

1656
02:10:02,120 --> 02:10:03,320
Dear Red:

1657
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:05,920
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1658
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:10,000
...and if you've come this far,
maybe you'd come a bit further.

1659
02:10:10,280 --> 02:10:12,640
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1660
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:16,240
Zihuatanejo.

1661
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:21,280
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1662
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:25,160
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1663
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,320
Remember, Red...

1664
02:10:27,600 --> 02:10:29,600
...hope is a good thing...

1665
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:31,720
...maybe the best of things.

1666
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:34,000
And no good thing ever dies.

1667
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:37,280
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1668
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:39,120
...and finds you well.

1669
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:40,760
Your friend...

1670
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,120
...Andy.

1671
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:16,200
"Get busy living...

1672
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,240
...or get busy dying. "

1673
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:22,880
That's goddamn right.

1674
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:30,000
For the second time in my life...

1675
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:32,680
...I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1676
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:35,560
Parole violation.

1677
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:39,680
Of course I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1678
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:42,320
Not for an old crook like me.

1679
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:44,440
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1680
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,520
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1681
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:56,120
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1682
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,720
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1683
02:11:58,920 --> 02:12:01,400
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

1684
02:12:04,280 --> 02:12:06,840
I hope I can make it across the border.

1685
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:11,200
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1686
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,880
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1687
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:19,800
I hope.
