The stage
The stage changed me.
Do you fear something? Dog, Snake or peacock? I fear public speech - speaking before a lot of people. You don’t believe it. Sometimes my evaluator said “Haijun is so relaxed and feels no pressure”. I smiled but with a wry taste. In fact when I delivered my speech my heart always beat so fast and my blood pressure was soaring. Maybe I can lose weight in this. Why? It is because I fear the public speech. I fear it because I fear the shame if I didn’t perform it. I fear it more I stay much far away from it. In fact I only have 2 public speeches before I joined JET. One was I needed to gather the homeworks  in the high school. I said “It’s them to present your homework”. Another one case is introducing myself when I joined the university. All of 3 students are from Beijing. I was very nervous so I said “I’m from Beijing” too. All laughed. I feared the public speech more! I stepped into a spiral. No practice no confidence. No confidence no practice.
One year ago I joined the Joint meeting with Caterpillar as a guest. It was the 2014 May 28th . Sherry tried to deliver her CC1 - a simple truth of happiness. But she forgot her draft and stunned at the stage for minutes. On a later meeting Sherry said she was very embarrassed and felt a great pressure at that time. I can understand that feeling and fear to be in that case. So I decided to not join the toast master. On July 18 JET hold a celebrating lunch. Youchao invited me. My brain told me to say no. But my stomach told me to yes. Maybe that day I was hungry.  I forgot my fear for a moment.  After the lunch I can’t refuse Youchao’s invitation to join the club because of the Chinese idiom “No refuse after meal” or “gifts blind the eyes”. I joined the club and tried to take some roles but I still fear to make the prepared speech. Until Sept 3rd Sherry presented her CC3 – sight viewing in US. She performed much better than her CC1. She just got several pause and delivered it as the whole. Later when Sherry delivered her CC4 and CC5 she delivered them very successfully and became the best speaker of that meeting. Sherry didn’t achieve that suddenly. She got it steps by steps, speech by speech. She seems not fear the stage any more. The speech is like the hammer, the stage is like Anvil. Every word is like a knock. These changed Sherry from Iron ore to the sword. The stage changed Sherry but not only her. As an audience of Sherry’s Speech and her changes I began to think maybe I can do that also. Franklin Roosevelt said “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself”. Maybe I can do the public speech even it is English.  I decide to change myself. I decided to make a try on this stage, try to deliver my prepared speech.

On Sept 17 I stood on this stage and delivered my CC1. As I had said I was very, very nervous. Even more nervous to see a girl after all there are more than one girl in this room. But after I finished it I found the stage is not so ??.
