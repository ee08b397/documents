The stage
Do you fear something? Dog, Snake or peacock? I fear public speech - speaking in front of some people. You don’t believe it. Sometimes my speech evaluator said “Haijun is so relaxed and feels no pressure”. I smiled but wryly. The truth is every time when I delivered my speech my heart always beat so fast and my blood pressure was soaring. Why? It is because I fear the public speech, I fear the stage. And I know many of you feel the pressure and feel uncomfortable when you stand on this stage. Hu Tao said she can feel the stomach hurt at the first two years she just joined toastmaster.
Everyone has his own reason for this. For me I fear the stage because I fear the shame that I can’t perform the speech well. I fear it because I don’t know how to do it. In the school we were trained to listening not talking. No practice no confidence. No confidence no practice. It’s like a spiral. I fear the stage more I stay farther away from it. And I don’t know what I can say and how can I perform on the stage. In fact I only have two kinds of speeches before I joined JET. One was I needed to help the teacher to gather the homework in the school. I said “Time to present your homework”. Another case is introducing myself when I joined a group, a class or a company. It should be easy but I failed on this one time. It was when I joined the university. Everyone needed introduce himself in the front of the whole class. What’s your name? Where do you come from? All of 3 students before me are from Beijing. I was so nervous at that time that I said “I’m from Beijing” too. All laughed. This resulted in that I feared the stage more! I stepped into the spiral. I didn’t like this status, this spiral but I didn’t know how to solve it. No, I know how to solve it but I dear not to take these several steps from the chair to this stage.
I believe everyone has a lot to share, to tell, everyone want to communicate. But the fear of the stage like my case drives us from the stage. I thought it will be always like this for my whole life. But someone changed me, her speeches inspired me.
One year ago I joined the Joint meeting with Caterpillar as a guest. It was the 2014 May 28th. Sherry tried to deliver her CC1 - a simple truth of happiness. But she forgot her draft and stunned at the stage for minutes. On a later meeting Sherry shared she was very embarrassed and felt a great pressure at that time. I can understand her feeling and fear to be in that case. 
On July 18 JET hold a celebrating lunch. Youchao invited me. My brain told me to say no. But my stomach told me to yes. Maybe that day I was very hungry.  I forgot my fear for a moment.  After the lunch I can’t refuse Youchao’s invitation to join the club because of the Chinese idiom “No refuse after meal” or “gifts blind the eyes”. 
I joined the club and tried to take some roles but I still fear to make the prepared speech. Until Sept 3rd Sherry presented her CC3 – sight viewing in US. She performed much better than her CC1. She just got several pause and delivered it as the whole. Later when Sherry delivered her CC4 and CC5 she delivered them very successfully and became the best speaker of that meeting.
I can see and I can feel Sherry didn’t achieve that suddenly. She got it steps by steps, speech by speech. The speech is like the hammer, the stage is like Anvil. Every word is like a knock. These changed Sherry from Iron ore to the sword. She seems not fear the stage any more. Now she has a strong heart in her slim body.
The stage changed Sherry but not only her. Sherry’s speeches inspired me. As an audience of Sherry’s Speech and her changes I began to think maybe I can do that like her. Maybe I can do the public speech even it is English.  I decide to change myself. I decided to make a try on this stage, try to deliver my prepared speech.
After I finished my draft I didn’t have a little confidence. So I turned to Hu Tao and did a rehearsal. Tao encouraged me greatly. On Sept 17 I stood on this stage and delivered my CC1. At that moment I was very, very nervous, even more nervous to see a girl. After all there was more than one girl in this room. But when I stood on the stage and took a deep breath I found the stage is not so fearful. I looked at the audience and can see the support the encouragement. Sometimes I forgot the exact words but I still can go on. I just say what I want to say. 
After speech and speech I found this stage is the best stage. We had the best mentor; she encourage us and teach us many skills. We have the best evaluator; they help us improve ourselves steps by steps. We have the best audience, they applause not laugh when we make mistakes. You can’t find another stage like this stage. This stage is priceless!
Now I still feel nervous on this stage. My heart beats very fast. Maybe I didn’t change so much for this field. But I don’t fear this stage any more. I don’t fear the fear itself any more. Just like Franklin Roosevelt said “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself”. 
And I know maybe I can influence other or change other, just like how Sherry’s speeches inspired me. Today I shared my feeling, my understanding and my story about the stage. This stage did not only changed me as the speaker and also change me as an audience. Please forget your fear. Please take these several steps and stand on this stage. Please join me and share your thoughts, your story and your passion. Please stand on this stage to change yourself, inspire us.
