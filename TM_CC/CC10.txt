The stage
Do you fear something? Dog, Snake or peacock? I do fear something. One of them is the stage. I fear to stand on the stage and speak in front of some people. You don’t believe it. Sometimes my speech evaluator said “Haijun is relaxed and feels no pressure”. I smiled but totally disagreed. The truth is every time when I stood on this stage and delivered my speech my heart always beat so fast and my blood pressure was soaring. And I know many peoples have this feeling when standing on the stage. We feel nervous and uncomfortable when we stand on this stage. Hu Tao said she can feel the stomach hurt at the first two years when she joined the toastmaster.
Everyone has his own reason for this feeling. For me it is because I fear the shame that I can’t perform the speech well. I fear it because I don’t know how to do it. In the school we were trained to listening not talking. No practice no confidence. No confidence no practice. It’s like a spiral. I fear the stage more I stay farther away from it. And I don’t know what I can say and how I can perform on the stage. 
In fact I only performed two kinds of speeches before I joined JET. One was I needed to help the teacher to gather the homework in the high school. I stood in front of the whole class and said “Time to present your homework”. Another case is to introduce myself when I joined a group, a class or a company. It should be easy but I failed on this once. It was when I joined the university. Everyone needed introduce himself in the front of the whole class. What’s your name? Where do you come from? All of 3 students before me were from Beijing. I was so nervous at that time that I said “I’m from Beijing” too. All laughed. I felt embarrassed and shame. This resulted in that I feared the stage more! I stepped farther away from the stage. 
I didn’t like this way because I want to speak my voice and share my ideas on the stage. I believe everyone has a lot to say, to share your experience, to tell your story. Everyone wants to communicate with others. This is from our hearts. This is our instinct. This is our needs. But the fear of the stage like my case drives us from the stage. I thought I will be always in this way for my whole life. But someone changed me, her speeches inspired me.
One year ago I joined the joint meeting with Caterpillar as a guest. On that meeting Sherry delivered her CC1. But she forgot her draft and stunned on the stage for minutes. On a later meeting Sherry shared her feeling at that moment. She was very embarrassed and felt a great pressure at that time. I can understand her feeling and fear to be in the same situation again. I even thought maybe Sherry dare not stand on this stage any more. 
Later I joined the club but I feared to stand on this stage to make the speech. Until Sept Sherry presented her CC3. She performed it much better than her CC1. She just got several pause and delivered it as the whole. In later meetings Sherry delivered her CC4 and CC5. She delivered them very successfully and became the best speaker of our club.
I can see Sherry’s changes and I can feel Sherry didn’t achieve that suddenly. She got it step by step, speech by speech. The speech is like the hammer, the stage is like Anvil. Every word is like a knock. These change Sherry from the Iron to the sword. I think she doesn’t fear the stage anymore because she has a strong heart in her slim body now after these.
The stage changed Sherry but not only her. Sherry’s speeches inspired me. Her courage inspired me. Her persistence inspired me. I don’t want to be a coward who always steps back from my fear. I want to fight back my fear like her.  I decided to change myself. I decided to make a try on this stage, try to deliver my speech.
I registered the role with a moment of excitation. I wrote my draft and recited it again and again. And Hu Tao helped me to do a rehearsal and encouraged me. However I was still very, very nervous before I stepped onto the stage. Even I thought maybe I make a wrong decision, which I will regret again. I will feel shame again. But when I stood on the stage and took a deep breath I found the stage is not so fearful. I looked at the audience and can see the support and the encouragement. Sometimes I forgot the exact words to say. But with your support and encouragement I still can go on. I just followed my mind and spoke what I want to say. 
Now I still feel nervous on this stage. My heart still beats very fast. Maybe I didn’t change much on this. But I don’t fear this stage any more. I don’t fear the fear itself any more. Just like Franklin Roosevelt said “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself”. Without the fear I can express my ideas. I can share my feelings; tell my story on this stage freely. I can feel the goodness of this stage.
After speech and speech I found this stage is the best stage. This stage is the best not because of the room, the light or the stage itself. It is because on this stage we had the best mentor; she teaches us many skills of speech and encourages us. It is because on this stage we have the best evaluators; they help us to improve ourselves step by step. It is because on this stage we have the best audience, they encourage us not laugh at us when we make mistakes. This stage is priceless! I almost missed this stage.  But now you should never miss it. You can not find another stage like this one any more. 
It is my story, my experience for the stage. Why I feared the stage. How Sherry’s speeches inspired me. How I forget the fear, stand on this stage and like it more and more. Please forget your fear. Please take several steps and stand on this stage. Please join me and share your thoughts, your story and your passion. Please stand on this stage to change yourself, inspire us.
