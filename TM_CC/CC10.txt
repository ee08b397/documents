The stage
The stage changed me.
Do you fear something? Dog, Snake or peacock? I fear public speech - speaking before a lot of people. You don’t believe it. Sometimes my evaluator said “Haijun is so relaxed and feels no pressure”. I smiled but with a wry taste. In fact when I delivered my speech my heart always beat so fast and my blood pressure was soaring. Maybe I can lose weight in this. Why? It is because I fear the public speech. I fear it because I fear the shame if I didn’t perform it. I fear it more I stay much far away from it. In fact I only have 2 public speeches before I joined JET. One was I needed to gather the homeworks  in the high school. I said “It’s them to present your homework”. Another one case is introducing myself when I joined the university. All of 3 students are from Beijing. I was very nervous so I said “I’m from Beijing” too. All laughed. I feared the public speech more! I stepped into a spiral. No practice no confidence. No confidence no practice.
One year ago I joined the Joint meeting with Caterpillar as a guest. It was the 2014 May 28th . Sherry tried to deliver her CC1 - a simple truth of happiness. But she forgot and stun at the minutes. She was very embarrassed and felt a great pressure at that time – she shared later. I fear to be in this case. So I decided to not join the toast master. On July 18 JET hold a celebrating lunch. Youchao invited me. My brain told me to say no. But my stomach told me to yes. That day I am hungry.  I forgot my fear for a moment. And I can’t refuse to join the club because of the Chinese idiom “No refuse after meal” or “gifts blind the eyes”. At Sept 3rd Sherry presented her CC3 – sightviewing in US. She performed much better than her CC1. She just got serveral pause and delivered it as the whole. Later when Sherry delivered her CC4 and CC5 she delivered them very successfully and became the best speaker of that meeting. Sherry didn’t achieve that suddenly. She got it steps by steps, speech by speech. She seems not fear the stage any more. The speech is like the hammer, the stage is like Anvil. Every word is like a knock. These changed Sherry from Iron ore to the sword. The stage changed Sherry but not only her. As an audience of Sherry’s Speech and her changes I began to think maybe I can do that also. Maybe I can do the public speech even it is English.  I decide to change myself. I decided to make a try on this stage.

Franklin Delano Roosevelt said"So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself---nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance". 
Fear will block you

Change little daily make great result
