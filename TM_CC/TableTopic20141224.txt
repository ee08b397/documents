I miss you, my home town.

I miss you my home town because I miss the blue sky.
I remember the cloud flying by
I remember the rainbow after the storm.
The Milky Way hanged over the sky at the night.

I miss you my home town because I miss the crops and field
I remember the wheat which is like the golden blanket.
I remember the corn which is like the green forest.
And the pink or white flowers of the cotton were so beautiful.

I miss you my home town because I miss the road to school
I remember the tall trees standing by the road like the guards
I remember the twinkling sunlight spots on the ground
How the soft wind kissed my face when I rode my bicycle.

I miss you my home town because I miss my old house.
I remember the apple tree in the yard and how delicious they were
I remember the pond in the front of the house because frogs always sing at the summer night
And the neighborhood - little swallows whispered to wake up me at the Morning

I miss you my home town because I miss the happiness to play games
I remember how happy I was when I flied the kite at the windy days.
I remember how focus I was when we played the game “hide and catch”
The cars, planes and animals made of the mud, ugly and still vivid to me.

I miss you my home town because I miss my chase of the knowledge.
I remember I laughed when I understood why the square root of two was an irrational number.
I remember I cried when I read Andersen’s story “the daughter of the sea”.
The smell of the book, paper and ink always come to my dreams till now.

I miss you my home town because I miss my friends.
I remember we caught the fish in the brooks together.
I remember we wandered in the village with a candle at the New Year's Eve
The jokes you told still let me smile till now.

I miss you my home town because I miss one girl
I remember your tears on your face when I hit you.
I remember your view of back when I followed you.
 But now the only thing I can do is pray, pray you are healthy and happy now.

I miss you my home town because I miss my grandfather and grandmother
I remember how happy I was when my grandpa seated me on his bicycle to visit his friends.
I remember how happy I was when my grandma gave me the cookies at the Chinese New Year.
But now the only thing I can do is pray, pray they are happy in the heaven.

I miss you my home town because I miss the happiness of my childhood
I miss you my home town because I miss the time past by and cannot come back
I miss you my home town because you are the only!
