Last week Tim made an announcement on his sexual orientation, Oh, Sorry Tim Cook, CEO of Apple. He mentioned Dr. Martin Luther King. This reminded me Martin's famous speech "I have a dream today!" I totally agreed with Dr King: everyone shouldn't be judged by his color, Height, gender or intelligence. So running is OK. There is not better or worse between swimming and running. So Qinqin, please consider another topic for your next speech.

Back to our theme - dream - we all have some dreams - what we want and want to be. And when we are asked what’s your dream. These answers varied year by year or even day by day. When I was a little boy, I borrowed a book from my desk mate. It was about ET, Area 51, canals on Mars.  I was so abstracted by this book. So when my desk mate asked me: "what’s your dream?" "Be an astronaut, I want to talk to E.T." I answered. Now I know that was not the correct answer. Forget it, we should move on, to our new dreams. So let start today's session.  

Now welcome todays' general evaluator Chi Fengxin and his evaluation team.

Ok Thanks Fengxin, Dai Gang and Jeff. Now it is the most interesting and chanlleging part - table topic, let's welcome Qinqin:
