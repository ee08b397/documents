Firstly let's welcome our todays' guests: He Min and Aber. OK lady first, He Min please make a self-introduction briefly.
Thanks you, He Min and Aber. Last week Tim made an announcement on his sexual orientation, Oh, Sorry I am talking about Tim Cook, CEO of Apple. In Tim's announcement he mentioned Dr. Martin Luther King. This reminded me Martin's famous speech "I have a dream today!" I totally agreed with Dr King: we all have a dream that no one should be judged by his race, color, height, gender or intelligence. So running is OK. There is not better or worse between swimming and running. Qinqin, stop to argue on this with me, please consider another topic for your next speech. 
Back to our topic, Dr King had a great dream and he fought for it many years. But to me, I had many dreams, and they are not great and may change. 
When I was a little boy, I borrowed a book from my desk mate. It was about ET, Area 51, canals on Mars. I was so abstracted by this book. So when she asked me: "whatâ€™s your dream?" "Become an astronaut, I want to fly to moon or Mars, and meet E.T." I answered. It took me years to realize that it was not the correct answer. 
But sometimes the exchange between dream and reality is very quick. Four years ago, He Min and YouChao interviewed me. We sat down. He Min introduced herself: "My name is He Min", "Wah, Am I in dream, Is here Hogwarts?". But later Youchao said "My name is Youchao". "Oh, not Harry" this brought me back to reality immediately. 
OK back to reality, let's start today's meeting. 
Now welcome todays' general evaluator Chi Fengxin and his evaluation team.
