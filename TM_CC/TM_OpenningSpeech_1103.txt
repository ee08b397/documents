Last week Tim CEO of Apple made an announcement on his sexual orientation, he mentioned Dr. Martin Luther King. This reminded me Martin's famous speech "I have a dream today!" I totally agreed with Dr King: everyone shouldn't be judged by his color, Height, gender or intelligence. So running is OK.

Back to the topic we all have some dreams. these dreams varied days by days. When I was a little boy, I borrowed a book from my desk mate. It is about "Extraterrestrial", Area 51, canals on Mars.  I was so abstracted by this book. So when my desk mate asked me: "what is your dream?" "Be an astronaut, I want to talk to E.T." I answered. Now I know that was not the correct answer. Forget it, we should move on. So let start today's session.
