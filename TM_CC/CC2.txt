Swimming

Tao and Qinqin had talked about their experience, their love to running, And Sherry had just finished her semi-marathon. Yeah running is pretty good. But I’d like to say: swimming is much better than running.

Firstly swimming can make us handsome or beautiful. When we swim, the water will lift up us and our spine and joints got relax. This will make us a bit taller, so day after day we got taller and taller. While when you run your weight will make you shorter and shorter. So we see the longest and largest animals are blue whales, they swim. Oh, don’t worry, we won’t got whale’s size, we never eat tons of food for our dinner, right? And when you run outdoors the sunlight and haze will hurt your skin and make it more and more dark. So we see many marathon players are from Africa and the champions are from Ethiopia. Do you want to become tall and white?

Secondly swimming gives us time to think. Everyday we are flooded by kinds of information from our family, colleague; from PC, mobile phone. So that we have less and less time for thinking. But when we swim we can think without any disturbance and attraction. You cannot answer the phone, you cannot talk to others and even you cannot glance at the beauties around. The only thing you can do, except swimming, is thinking. Think the working issues, family issues and even the prepared speech. We think more and more and may become clever and clever. Do you want to become clever?

Lastly swimming is a sport for whole life. When I go to swimming I can see a lot of older women and men. Someday I ask one “how old are you?” “Ah, pardon!” “how old are you?” “Ah seventy-eight!”, he answered. I strongly doubt he can run, but he still can swim. And more swimming can lengthen our life: everyone know turtle live longest. 

So it is very clear that swimming is better than running.
