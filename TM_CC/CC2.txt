Swimming

In the past several toastmaster meetings, Tao and Qinqin had talked about their experience, their love to running. And Sherry had just finished her semi-marathon. Yeah running is pretty good. But today I’d like to say: swimming is much better than running, based on the following five reasons:

Firstly swimming does less damage to our body. Several years ago I run and climb hills. But someday I feel pain in my left kneel. So I go to hospital the doctor suggest me run less. So I asked: ”Which sport should I do?”. “You should swim” He answered. So my kneels did not pain any more. When we run we must be carefully and skillful otherwise we would get hurt. Zhang Huailing just got hurt when he run because he did not notice an pit on the road.

Secondly swimming can make us more tall. When we swim, the water will lift up us and our spine and joints got relax. This will make us a bit taller, so day after day we got taller and taller. So we see, as Tao talked, the longest and largest animals are blue whales, they swim. Oh, don’t worry, we won’t got whale’s size, we never eat tons of food for our dinner, right? But when you run your weight will make you shorter and shorter. So leopard and antelope are pretty small and short.

Thirdly swimming can make us more white. The water in the swimming pool contains chlorine for sterilization, which can whiten our skin. But when you run outdoors the sunlight and haze will hurt your skin and make it dark. So we saw many marathon players are from Africa and the champions are from Ethiopia. But for swimming players we can see Sun Yang, Ning Zetao. Oh Sorry I forget an example just in this room: Dai Gan is our swimming champion. 

Fourthly swimming gives us time to think. Everyday we are flooded by kinds of information from our family or colleagues; from PC or mobile phone. So that we have less and less time for thinking. But when we swim, we can think without any disturbance and attraction. When we swim, we cannot answer the phone, we cannot listen to music, we cannot talk to others and even we cannot glance at the beauties around. The only thing we can do, except swimming, is thinking. Think about the working issues, family issues and even the prepared speech. Think will help us to build up the knowledge and make wise decisions. We think more and more and we will become more and more clever. 

Lastly swimming is a sport for our whole life. When I go to swimming I can see a lot of older women and men. Someday I ask one “how old are you?” “Ah, pardon!” “how old are you?” “Ah seventy-eight!”, he answered. I strongly doubt he can run, but he still can swim. And more swimming can lengthen our life: everyone know one fact: turtles live longest. They swim but don’t run. The oldest turtle lived more than one hundred and fifty years. And we all know rabbits live less then five years.

So you want to become tall and white? Do you want to become clever? Do you want live longer? It’s very clear that swimming is your best choice.
