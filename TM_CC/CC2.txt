Swimming is better than running

Last week I went to hospital because my kneels hurt. The doctor suggest not to hiking and less running. I ask swimming is OK. He said "Of course".

Swimming will do less damage on our kneels, our spine then running. Lao Zhang got hurt when he is running. And Sherry got arm broken. So running is pretty danger. The water will lift you when swimming.

Swimming will benefit almost all of your musules, your arm, your back, your legs and your neck.

You can lost weight by swimming too. Whale just eat too much. You never eat tons of food for one dinner. So don't warry about it.

Swimming can make us handsome and beautiful. when we swim the water will lift you. This will relax our kneels, neck and spine. Then when you get out of the water we will get a little taller, just like sleep. While if you run you may get shorter and shorter. When we swim the water will cool our skin and make it clean. While the dirty air will hurt us when we run and the skin will get loose because of the sweet and hot.

Swimming can obsolate us from other. When you run you can still listen to music, you can talk to your friends or yourself. You may answer a call. Can you do this when you swimmming. We are flooded by too many issues, for work, for friends and for family. But when you swim you are alone. The only thing you can do is thinking. In fact I draft my CC1 when I was swimming on the weekend's morning. We need such a time to think.

Swimming is even comfort then running. We can have a shower after the swimming and we never worry about PM2.5. It is good.

And we can still swimming when we are older. I saw a lot of grandpa and grandma when I swim. Can you found them run? So start to swimming and all your life.

Do you which animal lives longest? Yes, turtle.
