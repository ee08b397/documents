Swimming

Tao and Qinqin had talked about their experience on running, yeah running is good. but I’d like to say: swimming is better than running.


Firstly swimming can make us handsome and beautiful. When swim the water will left you up and your spine and joints got relax.This will make you a bit taller, so day after day we got taller and taller, while when you run your weight will make you shorter and shorter.
So we see the longest animals are blue whales, they swim. Oh, We just need eat less to control the weight. You never eat tons of food for your dinner, right? And when you run outdoors the sunlight and haze will hurt your skin and make it darker and darker. Many marathon players are from Africa. Everyone want to become taller and white so SWIM.

Secondly swimming give us time to think. All of us are flooded by kinds of issues, we have less and less time to think. But when we swim we can think without any disturbance and attraction. You cannot answer the phone, you cannot talked to others and even you cannot glance at the beauties around. The only thing you can do is thinking. Think the working issues, family issues and even the prepared speech. We think more and more and may become clever and clever. Do you know the dolphin have the second large brain!

Lastly swimming is a sport for whole life. When I go to swimming pool I can see a lot older women and men. Someday I ask one “how old are you?” “Ah, pardon!” “how old are you?” “Ah seventy-eight!”, he answered. I strongly doubt he can run, but he can swim. And everyone know turtle live longest.

So it is very clear that swimming are better than running. Come and join us. And you may become Ning Zetao or meet him!
