Small Things changed history
In the classical historical books the history is led by the great persons and marked with big issues. We learned how the emperor Qin Shi Huang created his dynasty and what happened in the world war. But today I＊d tell some small things, which changed the history. What are they? Wait a moment and let＊s go back to the beginning of human being＊s history.
Thousands of years ago the ancient human being made their lives on hunting animals or gathering fruit like Gorillas. But these foods were rare or un-stable. So the peoples must work very hard to struggle from hungry. Until thousands of years ago some small things were found 每 the seeds. The seeds of rice were found and planted in China about 8000 years ago. The seeds of wheat were found and planted in the west Asia about 9000 years ago. The planting of seeds can provided 10 times more food than hunting or gathering. With these foods the population increased greatly. People did not need work so hard anymore and began to how to write and build. The culture began to boom after this. Based on this we can say the seeds 每 just small seeds created the culture of human being and they are the base of the modern society. Without these seeds we won＊t have letter, science, tech, we can＊t sit here and talk, we still need hunt rabbits for our lunch. 
The seeds were so important that any things, which happened to the seeds, will become big issues. In 19 century Irishman began to plant potatoes because they produced more. This made the population increased more than 3 times, from 3 mill to 9 mill, in 100 years. But at 1840＊s the potato got sick known as potato blight and production decrease more than 80 %. And worse this continued 6 years. Nearly 2 mill died because of staving, which was one quarter of Irishman. It is called Irish Great Famine. And more than 1 mill left Ireland and went to US, which provided lots of workers. US benefited a lot from this. 
Why did potatoes get sick? The culprit was another small thing 每 a kind of germ. The germs were so much smaller than seeds that we even cannot see it directly. But they also changed the history so greatly. In Irish Great Famine, germs was responsible for 2 mill deaths.
In this case the germ did not killed peoples directly. But in another case, which was well known, it killed a lot. Smallpox, a virus from ox to human, was brought to America by Spanish 500 years ago. It killed much more Indians than the gun because Indians had no resistance to smallpox. In 100 years Indians in Mexico decreased from 20 mill to just 2 mill. Even in the just past 20th century Smallpox was responsible for an estimated 300每500 million deaths, which was much more than the world war! Smallpox only survived in labs now but AIDS or Ebola are still killing mill of people.
Generally the seeds survived the peoples while the germ killed people. But these two small things are connected not only because of this. In some way germs are the side effect of the seeds.
After human being planted seeds they began to feed animals with the excess food, e.g. ox or sheep. Many germs or virus were transferred from these animals to peoples, just like the smallpox. And people will not move anymore and gathered into towns and cities later, which also increased the risk and the damage. 
All in all some small things worked together and changed the history, not only the big issues or great ones as we had learned. In fact there are many other small things which changed the history but not notable.
