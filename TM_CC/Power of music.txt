Power of music

When I was a little boy, I like reading and drawing but not singing. I didn’t know why others like singing and music. 

But the music changed me at one day in the Sept of 2008. Seven years ago I visited Berlin for business. I wondered in the city at the weekend. It was cloudy, windy and a bit cold. And many Berliners only spoke Germany. I was a bit disappointed and in a low mood. At the 10 clock I arrived at the square of republic, which is like the TianAnMen square in Beijing. There I saw a group of younger, about twenty guys.  They are playing drum, dong-dong-dong. I have no idea to this day what’s the title or who’s the composer, but the music was so beautiful and powerful. It just like the sunlight which just come from the cloud, made me warm and excited. It was the first time I know the power of the music.

Later I began to like the music and love the music. And I knew more about the power of the music. The different music has different power. Some music has the power to tell story, like the Main Title by Ramin Djawadi in the TV show the Game of Throne, which Chi Fengxin played in his last speech. Some music has the power to relax us, like Summer of Joe Hisaishi in movie Kikujiro, we can feel the happiness of the little boy when he left the school and ran home. Some music can make us sad, we will feel the heart broken when we listen to Liang Zhu.

The music had many other powers, which I didn’t know. But where did the power come from or why the music has these powers? I think it is because the music is beautiful; it is the beauty of the sound, it is the beauty of the souls and it is the beauty of the nature. Everyone like the beauty, love the beauty and chase for the beauty. The beauty of music got echo from us. Our breathing, our pulse and our heartbeat followed the music, embraced the music and saluted to the music. The beauty of music inspires the power inside ourselves and leads us to itself; let us feel its power.

The power of Music has some advantages, which other communication method didn’t have, like talking, reading or drawing. Firstly the power of music can overcome the language. I didn’t understand Germany but I can get inspired by the music they played. Secondly the power of the music can overcome the age. I felt difficult to explain my jobs to my grandparents but they thought it pleasant and interesting when I played the songs of the legend of phoenix. Thirdly the power of the music can overcome the obstacle of civilization. Many African tribes don’t have their own writing, but they have their music.

I think my words are boring and cannot convince you because I haven’t the power of music. So I decide to let the music do this. This is the movie Shawshank Redemption. The major character Andy Dufresne was sentenced to the prison. One day he found a record and broadcasted to all of the prisoners, who may not know the name or composer, but they still can feel the beauty of music, the power of music. OK let see this part of video. This music is The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart, chapter 2.

Just like Red said, the music made those walls dissolve away and every man felt free. So please join us, remove the wall in your heart, embrace the music. And you will feel free and feel the power of music.
