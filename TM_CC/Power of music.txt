Power of music

When I was a little boy, I like reading and drawing but not singing, not music. I thought it was because I sang ugly and badly and didn’t know anything about music. There seemed be a wall between me and the music.

But the music changed me seven years ago. It was one day in the Sept of 2008. I visited Berlin for business. I wandered in the city at the weekend. It was cloudy, windy and a bit cold. And more many Berliners only spoke Germany, not English. I was a bit disappointed and in a low mood. At about 10 o'clock I arrived at the square of republic, which is like the Tiananmen Square. There I saw a group of youngers, about twenty peoples. They were playing drums, bass drums and snare drums, dong-dong-dong. These younger were like the troop marching to the battlefield, exciting, and powerful. The bass drums were like paces, strong and firm. The Snare Drums were like the breathing, short and quick. My heart beat with the music. My breathing followed the rhythm. The music was like the sunlight which just came from behind the cloud, made me warm and excited. I forgot all previous displeasure. It was the first time I knew the beauty of the music, the power of the music. The wall between me and the music began to collapse.

I sang still ugly and badly but from that day I began to listen to the music. When I listened more, I knew more about the music. The different music has different beauties, different power. Some music can tell story, like the Main Title in the TV show the Game of Throne, the drum and the violin seems repeating the story and the history. Some music can relax us, like Summer of Joe Hisaishi, the piano let us feel the happiness of the little boy when he left the school and ran home. 

I believed the music had many other powers, which I didn't know. But where did the power come from or why the music has the power? I think it is because the music is beautiful. The music is the beauty of the voice and the sound; the music is the beauty of the soul and the nature. We like music because we like the beauty, love the beauty. Our breathing, our pulse and our heartbeat followed the beats of the music, were synchronized to the rhythm of the music. The music inspires the power inside ourselves and leads us; unites us. So the music becomes the communication and connections between us.

So please join me, remove the wall in your heart, and embrace the music. You will feel the beauty of the music, feel the power of the music and feel free.
